## Source files and workflow
You can go a long way starting with plain-text Markdown files, which are converted to:

1. PDF through [a pandoc workflow](https://github.com/mrzool/cv-boilerplate) and a [LaTeX template](https://github.com/dartar/cvtex) 
2. HTML behind the scenes by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)

Alternatively, if you regard digital literacy as a strictly structured and hierarchical process given to us by a higher deity, you can always use a (self-proclaimed participatory) medium such as LinkedIn, ResearchGate, etc.

The motivation for this approach is outlined in a (draft) short article: [My timeline is bigger than yours](https://scholar.epidro.me/chorianopoulos_2020).
