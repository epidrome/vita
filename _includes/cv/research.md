
## Research statement

I have been doing research in the broad area of Human-Computer Interaction methods (human-centered software design and evaluation of its effects on humans), with a particular focus on the application domains of entertainment (since 2001) and learning (since 2008).

Every few years, depending on resources and contemporary developments, I am expanding skills and knowledge into a new application domain. Recently, I have become interested in well-being (since 2013) and culture (since 2018). Here, I am organizing research according to broad topics of public interest in order to make them more accessible to the general public.

### Entertainment, learning, well being, and culture

Since 2010, I have been exploring topics that influence e-learning and the quality of life, such as:

* serious video games: Children (and adults) have become highly engaged by computer video games. Is it possible to [design engaging video games that facilitate learning in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) topics]? What is the [effect of serious video games on student performance and attitudes]()?

* learning outside of the classroom: [What is the effect of mobile learning during a museum visit?]

* video-based learning: There are many ways to record a lecture on video, but [which video lecture format is the most effective and preferred by the students]?

* teaching computer programming: Computer programming has been treated in the classroom as a math or science topic, but the result has been fewer students being interested in learning, or at least understanding computer programming. [How can we engage students in computer programming?]

* healthy habits: Computers have been diffused into everyday activities such as [casual sports], eating, sleeping, etc.

* maker communities: [The projects, the structure, and the process of maker communities] provide an alternative to the mainstream and formal approaches to design, production, and learning.


The research framework bellow is organized according to two strands with respect to physical context (private and public space) and the type of activity (entertainment and learning).

### Public space, collaboration, telecommunication, and community awareness

Since 2006, I have been examining human activity outside the home and toward the public space, with a particular focus on informal educational settings and computer mediated communication. For this purpose, I am employing both established and novel interaction and communication technologies. Moreover, I am working closely with schools and teachers, in order to leverage their ability to adopt and adapt technologies in ways that are suitable for their skills and needs. Recently, I have been working on the following projects:

* mediacity: a scholarly investigation on the interdisciplinary area that is defined by architecture, urban studies, and media interaction.

* cult: a cooperation platform between schools that reside in rural areas of Europe.

* videopal: a field study on an asynchronous video link between USA and Greece.

* collaborative multi-user screens: tools and techniques for designing highly collaborative multi-touch surfaces that are more than the sum of the parts (User Experience Quality in Multi-Touch Tasks, Multi-user Chorded Toolkit for Multi-touch Screens)

* virtual communities: online 3D virtual worlds (Second Life), social networks (Facebook)

### Private space, family life, and multimedia production tools

Since 2000, I have been working on a broad set of research issues that consider an interdisciplinary area defined by human-computer interaction, multimedia design, and media communication. Most designers with an information technology (IT) background think about interactive television in personal computer terms. Although the academic background is in computer engineering, empirical research on the broadcast and the media industry --Hellenic Broadcasting, RAI research, Canal+, Danish Broadcasting-- has taught me several lessons, in complement to the IT mentality. In particular, I have done research on:

* multimedia authoring tools that are suitable for the workflow of TV producers, as well as for user participation (see papers: User Interface Programing for Interactive TV, The Evolution of TV Systems, Content, and Users Toward Interactivity)

* user interface software and design that facilitates viewer interactivity with the rich TV visual language (see papers: user interface design principles for interactive TV,  Animated character likeability revisited: The case of interactive TV)

* user evaluation methodology that concerns the uses and gratifications of TV by the audience (see papers: User Interface Evaluation of Interactive TV: A Media Studies Perspective and Learn and Play with Interactive TV)

* digital media management strategy that augments the established business model with alternative distribution and consumption channels, such as the Internet, mobile devices, etc (see papers: Coping with TiVo: Opportunities of the Networked Digital Video Recorder and Cross-media digital rights management for online music stores, Taking Social TV Beyond Chatting: How The TV Viewer Adds Value To The Network).

* social video retrieval:
