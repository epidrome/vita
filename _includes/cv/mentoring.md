## Mentoring

In addition to teaching (broadcasting of knowledge), I have been mentoring students toward an MSc, PhD thesis. So far, more than half of the thesis students under my supervision are publishing their final thesis as a research article in an international peer-reviewed venue (conference, journal).

I enjoy working with people who are passionate about interactive technologies and want to address important personal, social, and environmental challenges.

If you are interested in pursuing a PhD with me as advisor please contact me to discuss projects. If you are an ambitious and motivated BSc, MSc student and you are working in English, then feel free to drop me a line, we might be able to work together.
