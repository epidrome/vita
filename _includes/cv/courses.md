### Undergraduate

**Human-Computer Interaction (3rd semester, 6 ECTS, 80 students):** The [HCI course](https://github.com/courses-ionio/hci) provides an introduction to the breadth of human-centered computing. In addition to desktop user interfaces, the course introduces mobiles, CSCW, ubiquitous computing, entertainment, etc. The course is also complemented with student assignments that focus on empirical user analysis and user-centered design of computer applications, as well as software prototyping with Processing.

**Computer Supported Cooperative Work (4th semester, 4 ECTS, 20 students):** The [CSCW course](https://github.com/courses-ionio/cscw) provides an overview of theories as diverse as software, sociology, anthropology, and organizational behavior. This course is an (optional) follow-up to Human-Computer Interaction and students are working in groups in order to design, develop and evaluate groupware.

**Multimedia (5th semester, 5 ECTS, 40 students):** The [Multimedia course](https://github.com/courses-ionio/mm) is based on a practical personal project, which is performed in the Processing programming environment. Moreover, the course lectures provide a firm ground on both theory and contemporary practice in multimedia technology, design, management, and art.

**Software Technology (6th semester, 6 ECTS, 50 students):** Software engineering has been usually focused on the modeling and design aspects of large software projects. In addition to the established approach, the [Software Technology course](https://github.com/courses-ionio/sw) takes a pragmatic approach to the numerous and rather diverse daily activities of software construction. For this purpose, the theory and the mandatory project include case studies and practical exercise on tools and techniques that support the software development and maintenance process. I am mostly concerned with the user-aspect of software (UIST), while my colleagues support the system aspect.

Previous teaching program included: Computer and Internet Art, Cultural Informatics, ICT and Tourism, Multimedia Design, Audiovisual Techniques, Communication Theory, Computer Programming.

### Postgraduate

**Interaction Design (1st semester, 5 ECTS, 10 students):** The Interaction Design course provides a lecture-based introduction to the breadth of human-centered computing. In addition to desktop user interfaces, the course introduces mobiles, CSCW, ubiquitous computing, entertainment, etc. The course is complemented with a reading folder and critical presentations by the students.

**Computer Supported Cooperative Work (2nd semester, 5 ECTS, 10 students):** This course is complementary (optional) follow-up to Interaction Design and is based on a reading folder that includes the state-of-the-art in CSCW. Moreover, students are working in groups of two in order to produce original research in CSCW and present it in a final workshop: [schoolit10 workshop](https://sites.google.com/a/ionio.gr/schoolit10/), [schoolit11 workshop](https://sites.google.com/a/ionio.gr/schoolit11/).

**Ubiquitous computing (Distance education, 6 ECTS, 15 students):** The ubiquitous computing course has two dimensions: 1) A series of five lectures provides a solid background to the human factors aspect of computer technologies beyond the desktop and the server room, and 2) A hands-on series of projects, which employ either off-the-shelf technologies (camera, leds, sensors), or re-purposed consumer devices (mobile phone, mouse, keyboard), or the arduino system.
