In my free time, I like to surf (surfing and windsurfing). Here is a (growing) list of things that i have been learning while surfing:

* Adapt: The best way to stay on the board is to move all the time and according to the conditions.
* Travel: You cannot control the conditions but you can find a spot, where the conditions are closer to your preference.
* Fail: If you do not fall off your board at all, it probably means that you did not learn anything new on that day.
* Share: Although you can perfectly surf all by yourself, it is more effective (safe, learn, fun) to surf with others.
* Change: It is easy to go on a straight line, but very difficult to make a nice turn.
* Timing: You could have landed that turn, trick, jump, etc, if only you had a better timing between body, board, wave, wind, sails.
* Skills: Most things worthwhile doing have a steep learning curve especially in the beginning, but "the more you know, the more you know".
* Gadgets: Keep your gadgets updated, get to know their attributes, spend time maintaining them, but avoid "new is better".
* Body: While not on board, stay fit and sharp by cycling, swimming, rowing, pilates, meditation, eating, and sleeping.
* Stand up: Be explosive, but gentle.
* Exit: Sooner or later you will have to make an exit from that (not so) nice wave, you better have a strategy before hand.
* Landing smoothly: It is already quite hard to jump and even harder to do so with style, but the most challenging part is to land that aerial trick smoothly.
* Entry: Working your way out should be together with the current, not against it, save your stamina. 
* Look: You will (sooner than later) go towards where you look at, so make sure that you look towards where you really want to go to.
* Think: You become what you think about, you better choose your thinking and stick to it, at least for a while.

Sometimes, I think that the above findings might also apply to other life situations besides surfing.
