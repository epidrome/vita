## Introduction

I am doing research and teaching in the broad area of Informatics with an emphasis on the domains of user interfaces, video, video-games, gamification, crowdsourcing, software, learning, health.

**Research methodology:** human-centered software design, user study (field, experiment).

**Application domains:** Entertainment, learning, well-being, culture.

If you are a scholar, then you might want to access the [research publications](/papers/), in order to read the research results. In addition, if you are coming from an engineering, or an art and design tradition, then you might prefer the hands-on approach of the [Portfolio](http://portfolio.epidro.me) section.
