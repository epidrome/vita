If you are a scholar, then you might want to access the [research publications](http://scholar.epidro.me), in order to read the research results. In addition, if you are coming from an engineering, or an art and design tradition, then you might prefer the hands-on approach of the [Portfolio](http://portfolio.epidro.me) section.
