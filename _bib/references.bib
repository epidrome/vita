in their pedagogy, but there is limited understanding of the possible presentation styles. In practice, the presentation style of video lectures ranges from a direct recording of classroom teaching with a stationary camera and screencasts with voice-over, up to highly elaborate video post-production. Previous work evaluated the effectiveness of several presentation styles, but there has not been any consistent taxonomy, which would have made comparisons and meta-analyses possible. In this article, we surveyed the research literature and we examined contemporary video-based courses, which have been produced by diverse educational organizations and teachers across various academic disciplines. We organized video lectures in two dimensions according to the level of human presence and according to the type of instructional media. In addition to organizing existing video lectures in a comprehensive way, the proposed taxonomy offers a design space that facilitates the choice of a suitable presentation style, as well as the preparation of new ones.},

In this field study, potential differences in student motivation and learning were empirically examined through students' code. For this purpose, we performed a teaching intervention that took place over five weeks, with two-hour sessions per week, plus two more weeks for the pretest and post-test projects. Students were taught programming concepts through a science project; one group represented the function of a basic electric circuit by creating a simulation, while the other group represented the same function by creating a video game in which a player should achieve a score in order to win. Video game construction resulted in projects with higher CT skills and more primitives, as measured through projects' code analysis. Moreover, the video-game context seems to better motivate students for future engagement with computing activities.},

Nevertheless, there is a limited number of empirical studies in authentic classroom environments to support this assumption. In this study, we explored the synergy between embodied learning and educational robotics through a series of programming activities. Thirty-six middle school students were asked to create applications for controlling a robot using diverse interaction modalities, such as touch, speech, hand and full body gestures. We measured students' preferences, views, and intentions. Further- more, we evaluated students' interaction modalities selections during a semi- open problem-solving task. The results revealed that students felt more confident about their programming skills after the activities.

abstract = {Objectives Exergames can replace sedentary time spent on computer gaming with physical activity. Previous research has found exergaming to elicit light-to-moderate exercise intensity. Our primary aim was to examine the exercise intensity of a newly developed biking exergame. Methods Eight males (23.9±0.6 years) played the exergame (PLAY) and walked (WALK) on three separate occasions, with the condition counterbalanced and in random sequence within each day. They were asked to PLAY and WALK for a minimum of 15 min and then continue for as long as they wanted. We measured heart rate (HR), activity duration, caloric expenditure and subject-rated exertion and enjoyment (based on 0–10 Visual Analogue Scale, VAS). We used an average of each outcome variable across the 3 days in the analysis. Results The average intensity during PLAY (73{\%}±10{\%} of HRmax) was significantly higher than that during WALK (57{\%}±7{\%} of HRmax, p=0.01). Participants spent 12.5±5.3 min at 80{\%}–89{\%} of HRmax and 5.5±4.6 min at ≥90{\%} of HRmax during PLAY, whereas intensity during WALK was ≤72{\%} of HRmax. The duration of PLAY was 44.3±0.7 min and of WALK 17.0±0.7 min (p=0.01). The relative energy expenditure during PLAY was 7.6±0.7 kcal/min and during WALK 6.2±0.3 kcal/min (p{\textless}0.01). The enjoyment of PLAY (VAS 8.7±0.1) was higher than that of WALK (VAS 3.9±1.8, p=0.01). Conclusions Exergaming can be an innovative way of enjoyable high-intensity training.},

There are many tangible hardware platforms for introducing computer programming to children, but there is limited comparative evaluation of them in the context of a formal classroom. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning to code for tangible computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for the desktop computer. For this purpose, 36 students participated in a within-groups study that involved three types of target computer platform tangibility. 1) desktop, 2) wearable, and 3) robotic. We employed similar blocks-based visual programming environments, and we measured emotional engagement, attitudes, and computer programming performance. We found that students were more engaged by and had a higher intention of learning programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible computing platforms, either robot or wearable, did not affect the students’ performance in learning basic computational concepts (e.g., sequence, repeat, and decision). Our findings suggest that computer programming should be introduced through multiple target platforms (e.g., robots, smartphones, wearables) to engage children.},

Pedestrian routes have only been considered as an add-on option in existing digital maps and the respective data collection has not been performed in the field. In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection. The visualization of the pedestrian-generated data on a map required a partially manual process, thus, further research should explore the gamification of the data visualization part, too.},

that all users perform exactly the same task (e.g., moving and resizing photos), or that they negotiate individual actions in
turns. However, there is limited user interface software that supports simultaneous performance of individual actions during
shared tasks (Fig. 1a). As a remedy, we have introduced multi-touch chords (Fig. 1b) and personal action windows (Fig. 1c) for
co-located collaboration on a large multi-touch vertical display. Instead of selecting an item in a fixed menu by reaching for
it, users work simultaneously on shared tasks by means of personal action windows, which are triggered by multi-touch chords
performed anywhere on the display. In order to evaluate the proposed technique with users, we introduced an experimental task,
which stands for the group dynamics that emerge during shared tasks on a large display. A grounded theory analysis of users'
behaviour provided insights into established co-located collaboration topics, such as conflict resolution strategies and space
negotiation. The main contribution of this work is the design and implementation of a novel seamless identification and
interaction technique that supports diverse multi-touch interactions by multiple users: multi-touch chord interaction along
with personal action windows.},

examined in order to swift from a single-touch WIMP interaction paradigm to a MT one.In this work, we focus on chord
interaction on vertical MT screens. Chord is the simultaneous touch of more than one finger on the MT screen. Based on a user
experiment with 12 users, we explore the positioning - interaction space of the chord technique, by investigating a relation
among the type of the chord (number of fingers) and the position on the screen that the chord was applied. The empirical
results have indicated an interaction pattern that demonstrates a significant relation between the type of the chord that was
applied (number of fingers) and its position on the screen. Our results show that as the number of fingers needed for a chord
increases, the nearer from the bottom left of the screen this chord is to be applied. Notably, our results give evidence of the
fact that there is a threshold (five-finger-chord) beyond which the above relation is not strong.},

all the possible cases are being examined and the rules that define the new ranking are put forward. Furthermore, we apply this
method to video lectures derived from YouTube. The findings of the experiments show that the addition of the social weight

insights through the lens of the collected video analytics. In particular, we found that there is a relationship between video
navigation (repeated views) and the level of cognition/thinking required for a specific video segment. Our results indicated
that learning performance progress was slightly improved and stabilized after the third week of the video-assisted course. We
also found that attitudes regarding easiness, usability, usefulness, and acceptance of this type of course remained at the same
levels throughout the course. Finally, we triangulate analytics from diverse sources, discuss them, and provide the lessons
learned for further development and refinement of video-assisted courses and practices.},

video analytics to represent learner behavior. Further research, should be able to elaborate on learner behavior by collecting

even the simple user heuristic of local maxima might effectively detect the same video-events, as indicated manually. Notably,
the proposed technique was more accurate in the detection of events that have a short duration, because those events motivated
increased user interaction in video hot-spots. The findings of this research provide evidence that we might be able to infer

addition operations in a seamless way, which has been inspired by that of classic platform games. In this way, the students are
adding numbers as part of popular gameplay mechanics and as a means to reach the video game objective, rather than as an end in
itself. The employment of well-defined principles in the design of math video games should facilitate the evaluation of
learning effectiveness by researchers. Moreover, educators can deploy alternative versions of the games in order to engage
students with diverse learning styles. For example, some students might be motived and benefited by narrative, while others by
collaboration, because it is unlikely that one type of serious video game might fit all learning styles. The proposed

Although there are many and diverse ways of designing learning videos, there is limited understanding of the efficacy and
usefulness of each method. Therefore, we survey the state-of-the-art in the design, development and evaluation of open and
video-based courses. The main objective is to highlight the importance and benefits of analytics and to support instructors
with the appropriate resources for improving the use of their courses. This can be achieved by combining and analyzing
learners' interactions with other available data obtained from learners, as such video analytics open new avenues for research
on open and video-based courses. In addition to the guidelines for video-based analytics we have selected five indicative
case-studies that provide in-depth analysis..},

Accordingly, it is proposed that the aggregated users' video activity exhibits characteristic patterns. Such patterns may be
used in order to infer important video scenes leading thus to collective intelligence concerning the video content. To this
end, experimentation is based on users' interactions (e.g., pause, seek/scrub) that have been gathered in a controlled user
experiment with information-rich videos. Collective information seeking behavior is then modeled by means of the corresponding
probability distribution function. Thus, it is argued that the bell-shaped reference patterns are shown to significantly
correlate with predefined scenes of interest for each video, as annotated by the users. In this way, the observed collective
intelligence may be used to provide a video-segment detection tool that identifies the importance of video scenes. Accordingly,

measured the distance covered for each one of the workouts. We found that augmented feedback from mobile self-tracking devices
can promote working out, but there is also a trade-off of increased anxiety and disorientation. Thus, we suggest that sports
tracking software should be modest about how much and what type of visual information it provides to the user. In particular,
we found that the only piece of visual information that had an impact on performance was average speed, which indicates a
connection with gamication. Further research should consider additional levels of gamification beyond score, such as graphics,

particular, there is limited research on guidelines for usable video lecture design, such as the presence of humans in the
video and navigation support through the video. For example, it is established that learners benefit from highly structured
learning material, but the manual editing of video is not feasible for most learning organizations and instructors. In order to
accommodate this emerging instruction medium we are drawing design principles and models from the research literature on
educational technology and video interaction. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive approach to the design of usable video
lecture systems and content. Finally, we suggest that learning organizations and instructors should invest additional effort in
video systems that support an integrated approach to editing, sharing, and controlling of video lectures.},

learn about an unstructured video just by analyzing the dynamics of how it is being used. In particular, we explore three
pillars of online user activity with video content: 1) Seeking patterns within a video is linked to interesting video segments,
2) Sharing patterns between users indicate that there is a correlation between social activity and popularity of a video, and
3) Editing of live events is automated through the synchronization of audio across multiple viewpoints of the same event.
Moreover, we present three complementary research methods in social video retrieval: Experimental replication of user activity
data and signal analysis, data mining and prediction on natural user activity data, and hybrid techniques that combine robust
content-based approaches with crowd sourcing of user gener- ated content. Finally, we suggest further research directions in
the combination of richer user- and content-modeling, because it provides an attractive solution to the personalization,
navigation, and social consumption of videos.},

the resulting key-frames are the same regardless of the user preferences. We developed the open-source SocialSkip system on a
modular cloud-based architecture and analyzed hundreds of user interactions within difficult video genres (lecture, how-to,
documentary) by modeling them as user interest time series. We found that the replaying activity is better than the skipping
forward one in matching the semantics of a video, and that all interesting video segments can be found within a factor of two
times the average user skipping step from the local maximums of the replay time series. The concept of simple signal processing
of implicit user interactions within video could be applied to any type of Web video system (e.g., TV, desktop, tablet), in

information seeking behavior as a time series and the semantic regions as a discrete pulse of fixed width. We constructed these
pulses from user interactions with a documentary video that has a very rich visual style with too many cuts and camera
angles/frames for the same scene. Next, we calculated the correlation coefficient between dynamically detected user pulses at
the local maximums and the reference pulse. We have found when people are actively seeking for information in a video, their

previous work in content-based information retrieval and provides an additional user-based dimension for modeling the semantics

  abstract      = {In this paper, we propose a user-based video-indexing method, that automatically generates thumbnails of the
most important scenes of an online video stream, by analyzing users' interactions with a web video player. As a test bench to
verify our idea we have extended the YouTube video player into the VideoSkip system. In addition, VideoSkip uses a web-database
(Google Application Engine) to keep a record of some important parameters, such as the timing of basic user actions (play,
pause, skip). Moreover, we implemented an algorithm that selects representative thumbnails. Finally, we populated the system
with data from an experiment with nine users. We found that the VideoSkip system indexes video content by leveraging implicit
users interactions, such as pause and thirty seconds skip. Our early findings point toward improvements of the web video player
and its thumbnail generation technique. The VideSkip system could compliment content-based algorithms, in order to achieve
efficient video-indexing in difficult videos, such as lectures or sports.},

views and the duration of a video message significantly depend on the gender of the viewer and creator. Most notably, girls
created more messages, but boys viewed their own messages more. Finally, there are video messages with numerous views, which
indicates that some videos have content qualities beyond the communication message itself. Overall, the practical implications
of these findings indicate that the developers of asynchronous VMC should consider functionalities for preserving some of the
video messages.},

Previous research in user-based techniques has assumed an extra effort from the users, such as video replies, comments, tags,
and annotations. We have developed and evaluated the SocialSkip system, which improves sense making of web videos by
visualizing the simplest form of user interactions with video, such as pause, and seek. In contrast to previous stand-alone
implementations, the SocialSkip system employs a web-video player and cloud-based resources (application logic, database,
content). The system was validated with two user studies, which provided several hundreds of user interactions with five types
of web video (sports, comedy, lecture, documentary, how-to). We found that seeking activity within web video is reversely
proportional to how interesting the video is. Moreover, we suggest that if the users are actively seeking for information
within a video (e.g., lecture, how-to), then the user activity graph could be associated with the semantics of the video.
Finally, SocialSkip provides an open architecture for collaborative contributions to the analysis of the user activity data, in
a fashion similar to the TRECVID workshop series.},

In the two-user condition, we found that performance and enjoyment was always higher than the single-user conditions,
regardless of input device and task. Besides the quantitative results, we observed that users employed diverse interaction
strategies in the MT condition, such as bi-manual input. The proposed tasks and the results support the use of MT in

Social Network Surfing, Wasting Time, Using Applications. Finally, the results were analyzed in order to interpret each

to primarily regard Facebook as a means of socializing with other users, but also the extent to which Facebook has become a
part of their daily routine, something that is indicated by the impact of the "Wasting Time" factor. Further research can be
conducted by addressing a greater number of users, selected with a less random manner and possibly with a different (cultural,

  abstract      = {The approach often adopted by Human Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on exchanges between a person and the
interface of a device situated within a specific context of use. This view is increasingly challenged by the complex and
dynamic world of the physical and social environment integrated with ubiquitous technologies, which requires an alternative
view that sees people creating settings which frame and structure their encounters. As a result, in recent years, HCI
researchers have recognized the need for social and physical data to be gathered and interpreted, but have often been
frustrated in their attempts to codify and make sense of the complex and dynamic nature of the real world of human experience.
Developments in the early 90s such as the emergence of the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), the
introduction of the concept of social navigation (Hook et al. 2003), work on ambient environments, the UbiComp conference
series as well as more theoretical positions on embodied or situated interaction (Dourish 2001, McCullough 2005) have all lead
the way to a new understanding of HCI. Another driver for this change in emphasis in HCI is the emergence of mobile and
ubiquitous computing that has brought significant changes in social and cultural practices in spatial settings. Interactions
through and with ubiquitous technologies no longer require physical co-presence and have broadened the range of possible
interactions as well as the range of settings in which these interactions can unfold. The basis for this lies in the fact that
physical distance no longer prevents many of the types of interactions and encounters that had previously been confined to
face-to-face contact. As a result, there has been much discussion on the role of spatial setting and interaction mediated
through technologies such as that on the role of space and agency in the quality of the interaction (Dourish and Harrisson
1996) and also the broader concept of the situated behavior and actions (Suchman 1987). A good deal has also been written on
the subject of social collaboration among individuals using communication devices and the conditions or features that are
required to enable such activities (Gaver 1992; Paulos and Goodman 2004; Hook et al. 2003; Churchill et al. 2004). Further
discussion has focused on the technologies themselves, assessing the social impact of the emerging forms of behavior, such as
the activities of ad hoc communities enabled through mobile technologies (Rheingold 2002), or the patterns of mobile phones'
use (Katz and Aakhus 2002). Finally, numerous applications and locative media projects (e.g., Harle and Hopper 2005) which
explore interactions through realization have been developed. These projects and research offer many useful insights, but there
still remain many questions about how to create the conditions for meaningful and persisting shared interactions in public
space. The challenge is not only to build systems that respond to rich and dynamic social and physical events, but also to
provide a structure for sustainable participation and sharing.},

chapters on a different topic and is introduced by a key author in the field who provides an overview of the content. The book
itself is introduced by Paul Dourish, who sets the theme of shared encounters in the context of technological and social change
over the last fifteen years. The four sections that follow consider the characteristics of shared encounters and describe how
they can be supported in different settings: the first section, introduced by Barry Brown, looks at shared experiences. George
Roussos, in the second section, presents playful encounters. Malcolm McCulloch introduces the section on spatial settings and '
last but not least ' Elizabeth Churchill previews the topic of social glue. The individual chapters that accompany each part
offer particular perspectives on the main topic and provide detailed insights from the author's own research background. A
valuable reference for anyone designing ubiquitous media, mobile social software and LBS applications, this volume will also be
useful to researchers, students and practitioners in fields ranging from computer science to urban studies.},

between alternative icons used for the same mobile phone feature. Moreover, we found that original manufacturer icons performed
better than those offered by the wireless operator. Simple metaphors from the real world and consistent visual depictions
across different handsets performed best for mobile phone icons, while abstract concepts had the lowest recognition rates.
Designers of mobile phone icons have to balance a trade-off between the need of the manufacturers and wireless operators to
differentiate their offerings through branding, and the need of the consumers for a familiar visual language in mobile phone
menus.},

  abstract      = {The ability to deliver personalized advertising messages has long been a major objective in marketing since
it allows marketers to meet heterogeneous consumer needs and target their messages more effectively (Arens {\&} Bovee, 1994).
However, traditional one-to-many marketing approaches applied in mass media suffer from their inability to meet this objective
(Dibb, 1998; Hoffman {\&} Novak, 1997). In order to increase the efficiency of their strategy, marketers identify homogeneous
groups of consumers (market segmentation) which they target according to their marketing objectives. Thus, market segmentation
has become the most important marketing tool for targeting purposes (McBurnie {\&} Clutterbuck, 1998), also utilized in the TV
advertising domain in conjunction with domain-specific features such as time zones and/or program typologies. However, this
strategy has admittedly little to offer towards the ultimate goal of one-to-one communication, since the targeted unit is the
segment rather than the individual consumer, and therefore individual needs cannot be satisfied. In the broadcasting television
advertising domain, media coverage either exceeds the targeted market segment or leaves potential customers without exposure to
the message, thus reducing its cost effectiveness (Belch {\&} Belch, 1995). At the same time, TV viewers have to deal with a
vast amount of available advertising information. The issue of information overload, typical in information theoretic terms, is
also experienced in the case of TV advertisements as advertising clutter, which has been identified as one of the significant
factors associated with the negative attitude of viewers towards advertising and can have a negative impact on television
advertisement recall or recognition (Mord {\&} Gilson, 1985). Relevant surveys reveal that 80{\%} of the viewers feel that
there is “too much advertising in television” (Elliott {\&} Speck, 1998), while more than 75{\%} of consumers are not happy
with the broadcasted advertisements (Hawkins, Best, {\&} Coney, 1998 ). Current target marketing methods are limited in their
ability to efficiently target consumers at the individual level, particularly in mass media such as television. Thus,
personalization of advertisements provides marketers with the opportunity to increase advertising effectiveness by targeting
consumers who are most likely to respond positively to the advertising message. The present article investigates appropriate
personalization methods for the domain of digital television advertisements by examining relevant methods utilized for
personalized Web applications. In addition, it is concerned with the design of the interactive elements of a typical 30-second
advertisement in support of the personalization process. The two objectives of this article are interrelated: the selection of
a personalization technique affects the design of interactive advertisements since it indicates the type of interaction data
that should be collected in order to enable personalization. The next section of this article opens up the discussion on
personalization from a theoretical point of view and in the following section specific personalization techniques are compared.
Next, the types of interaction data required to achieve personalization are discussed and the article concludes with further
discussion and conclusions.},

social communication patterns between users in online 3D worlds. In particular, we found that users with more elaborate avatars
had a higher success rate in their social encounters, than those users with the default avatars. The implications of this study

has always been a social activity. People watch television together in their living rooms, and outside their homes they talk
about last night's football match; and even call each other to recommend an interesting program. Unfortunately, until recently,
research on social interactive television has been scarce. One limiting factor for the development of innovative services for
the home is the interactive technology behind user interaction, which was limited to the remote control. Fortunately, a number
of studies concentrate on extending interactive methods, for example by using contextual information. This article reviews the
state of the art in these two directions: the social aspects of television and user interaction. We conclude with a research
agenda for further research, which might transform current interactive television services into shared experiences.},

technology, the field of communication science was explored, which has accumulated an extensive theory of TV usage and viewer
behavior. For the empirical validation, the principles were employed in the design of an interactive music TV application. The
results suggest that a small set of generic principles could support the systematic design of ITV applications and produce a
design rationale that is traceable and comparable to alternative solutions, during the process of early product development. In
addition, the principles could be refined into specific guidelines and further employed to support expert evaluation

Previous works on social television systems belong to two categories: 1) studies on how collocated groups of viewers socialize
while watching TV, and 2) studies on novel Social TV applications (e.g. experimental set-ups) and devices (e.g. ambient
displays) that provide technological support for TV sociability over a distance. The main shortcoming of those studies is that
they have not considered the dominant contemporary method of Social TV. Early adopters of technology have been watching and
sharing video online. We employed cultural probes in order to gain in-depth information about the social aspect of video
sharing on the internet. Our sample consisted of six heavy users of internet video, watching an average of at least one hour of
internet video a day. In particular, we explored how they are integrating video into their daily social communication
practices. We found that internet video is shared and discussed with distant friends. Moreover, the results of the study
indicate several opportunities and threats for the development of integrated mass and interpersonal communication applications

multimedia computing has enabled the processing of TV content on personal devices such as mobile phones and PCs. The above
developments raise novel issues and require the adoption of new multimedia standards and application frameworks. In particular,
the explosion in the amount of available TV channels over digital television platforms (broadcast or internet protocol) makes
searching and locating interesting content a cumbersome task. In this context, personalization research is concerned with the
adaptation of content (e.g. movies, news, advertisements). Personalization is achieved with the employment of algorithms and
data collection schemes that predict and recommend to television viewers content that match their interests. In addition, the
distribution of TV content to mobile devices over broadband wireless raises the issue of video quality. Video quality depends
on many aspects of the video encoding systems, such as bit rate and algorithms that model human perception of video on small
screens. In this article, we examine contemporary research in personalized and mobile digital TV applications. Moreover, we
present a critical survey of the most prominent research and provide directions for further research in personalized and mobile

has not been evaluated with casual users in public spaces for prolonged periods of time. As a matter of fact, the most
interesting effects of distance communication systems on everyday life, such as community identity, community awareness, and
civic participation have not been documented. We plan to deploy an ambient and social interactive TV platform that supports

interactive TV as content creation, 2) interactive TV as a content and experience sharing process, and 3) interactive TV as

computer engineering and advertising research. We have also collaborated with network and multimedia engineers, with
broadcasters, and we examined novel interactive television (ITV) prototypes. The findings suggest that the networked DVR could
be exploited to provide personalized channels and that the dynamic advertising insertion could be introduced as an effective

  abstract      = {Television use does not require high skill or effort, which is ideal as a paradigm of use for ambient user
interfaces. In this paper, universal access in ambient intelligence is modeled after the use of TV in everyday life. Instead of
considering television only as a content medium and the focus of user activity, an alternative approach is to consider
television use as a secondary function to other activities, such as socializing, domestic chores, leisure pursuits. For this
purpose, the requirements for ambient user interactivity with TV are organized in a small set of design principles. The design
principles have been selected, analyzed and synthesized from readings in previous works on media and ethnographic studies about
television, and everyday life. It is suggested that universal access in ambient intelligence is promoted by considering design
principles such as opportunistic interaction, user participation, group interactions, and multiple levels of attention to the
user interface. Finally, the principles have been tested in the design of a user interface for interactive music television.
This preliminary case suggests that the proposed principles facilitate the design of user interfaces that blend seamlessly with
everyday life.},

enduring and meaningful exchanges. Shared encounters are the glue of social networks and have a socializing effect in terms of
mutual understanding, empathy, respect and thus tolerance towards others. The quality and characteristics of such encounters
are affected by the setting, or situation in which they occur. In a world shaped by communication technologies, non-place-based
networks often coexist alongside to the traditional local face-to-face social networks. As these multiple and distinct on and
off-line communities tend to carry out their activities in more and more distinct and sophisticated spaces, a lack of coherency
and fragmentation emerges in the sense of a shared space of community. Open public space with its streets, parks and squares
plays an important role in providing space for shared encounters among and between these coexisting networks. Mobile and
ubiquitous technologies enable social encounters located in public space, albeit not confined to fixed settings, whilst also
offering sharing of experiences from non-place based networks. We will look at how to create or support the conditions for
meaningful and persisting shared encounters. In particular we propose to explore how technologies can be appropriated for
shared interactions that can occur spontaneously and playfully and in doing so re-inhabit and connect place-based social
networks.},

  abstract      = {This doctoral dissertation aims to investigate user interface (UI) design, implementation and evaluation for
interactive television (ITV) applications. Computer mediated entertainment (e.g. video-games, digital music, DVD movies, ITV)
has emerged as a major economic factor in the media industry, taking-up a large portion of consumer spending and leisure time.
Advances in set-top box technology made possible the digital video recorder (DVR) and Internet connectivity, thus making the
television interactive. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the established human-computer interaction (HCI)
theory against the requirements of ITV applications. Previous HCI research about ITV focused only on the design of the
electronic program guide (EPG) and did not consider the enhancement of the TV content. Furthermore, previous research
approached ITV from a single perspective (e.g. computer engineering, advertising, communication) and it did not consider the
conflicts of interest between the broadcasters and the consumers, between the developers and the producers, and more crucially,
it did not consider the ITV user as a TV viewer. For this purpose, the established TV watching behavior is identified in other
scientific disciplines, such as advertising and communication, and it is combined with the Information Technology (IT)
usability mentality. The design methodology involves two phases. The objective of the first design phase is to formulate a
small set of principal elements that are generic to the design of ITV UIs, such as Virtual Channel conceptual model, UI
principles, UI development toolkit, prototyping platform, and affective usability evaluation framework. The objective of the
second design phase is to employ the elements identified in the previous stage into the development of an ITV application. The
ITV application was evaluated by consumers and addressed three contemporary UI issues: video skipping, animated character, and
dynamic advertisement insertion. Overall, the methodology employed a holistic design approach for ITV applications, in which
the UI model and the business model were systematically mapped to and validated through an ITV music application. In brief, it
was found that the track-skipping UI seamlessly enhanced consumer entertainment. Moreover, it was found that an animated
character is preferred, when compared with the traditional transparent box for the presentation of related information.
Consumers evaluated the dynamic advertisement insertion positively, thus, opening-up many opportunities for novel advertising
formats. The employment of the proposed HCI elements made the design and the development of the ITV application a
straightforward process and produced an entertainment experience that was liked by the consumers. The results entail
significant implications for the TV industry. ITV is currently perceived as a set of decorative elements, which do not provide
any actual improvement of the existing TV content. On the other hand, video-skipping is a familiar functionality that should be
exploited, instead of neglected due to the fear of cannibalizing the fixed advertising of the broadcast schedules. The dynamic
advertisement insertion in the TV content stream offers a novel advertising format. Finally, there are opportunities for a new
mediating role in the media industry that combines the available broadcast transmission with additional elements (Internet
resources, computer generated graphics) for the provision of personalized virtual television channels.},

possibilities for the viewer, who can directly access relevant information and other services being just one-click away. In
this context, personalisation of advertisements refers to the use of technology and viewer information in order to tailor
commercials and their respective interactive content to each individual viewer profile. In this paper we deal with the topic of
advertising over digital interactive TV and describe a specific approach to the delivery of personalised interactive
advertisement content to viewers based on their individual profile, focusing on the necessary architecture, mechanisms and user

TV viewers who will respond similarly to marketing actions, and thus develop their target advertising techniques. The consumers
are equipped with a settop box (STB) with storage facilities and a modem. The definition of consumer profiles and clusters is
based on demographics, preferences, and analysis of the consumer interactions with the TV, which are tracked automatically. In
order to protect consumers' identities, consumer data are stored locally on the STB and the classification of a consumer in a
specific cluster takes place at the client side. Consumer data from the consumers, who permit it, is periodically transferred
to the Server where Data Mining techniques are applied. The extracted consumer behavioral rules associate the clusters with
consumer profiles and interaction/navigational data and are sent through the broadcast channel to the consumers' STBs for the
classification of each consumer and the playback of the advertisements that match consumer interests.},

as iTV, combines the appeal and mass audience of traditional TV with the interactive features such as those currently available

of challenges involved in the designing of interactive TV applications. These are related with the differences of the medium
