abstract="New technologies and media aim at triggering student interest in mathematics and at making learning an entertaining process. However, playful math games need to provide learners with a better experience, which is connected with an engaging gameplay. Popular game mechanics could be used in order to integrate learning in the playing activities. This research employs the Super MarioÂ game format for the design of a playful educational serious game in the context of math education. Mario Maths is addressed to students of 12 and 13 years old and aims to the practice of divisibility criteria. Mario collects numbers instead of coins that must be exactly divided with the number - target, avoiding or eliminating the wrong answers. A wrong choice transports Mario to a subterranean world which informs him for his mistake, but with no influence on the final goal achievement according to a constructive error and trial method. In the end of each track, the player is taking feedback of his effort in a self-assessment process. Mario Maths was developed to be used as a complementary educational tool for students who might be attracted from such forms of media. (https://github.com/ionio-seriousgames/mario-maths).",

abstract="While digital technology adoption by older adults rises constantly, the design of new technologies often overlooks the culture of the end users, which, in turn, has an impact on the acceptance and use by many of them. Based on the fact that technology adoption by this age group in Greece remains low, compared to the vast majority of the EU countries, our goal in this paper is to gain further insights into the user requirements of older adults as web 2.0 storytellers in order for designers to better address their needs. For this purpose, we implemented participatory design with five older adults in Greece over a twelve-week period, combined with an evolutionary prototyping approach, as we noticed during our sessions that our participants had a difficulty in envisioning and proposing novel technologies. In order to analyze and interpret the feedback that we collected during the design sessions, the digital storytelling sessions and the in-depth interviews, we made use of the Activity Theory, as well as age-related and self-presentation frameworks. Through probing our participants' usage and design preferences of the storytelling platform, we came up with a set of attributes and motives that seem to expound their online choices. Issues of loneliness and social inclusion, generativity and computer mediated communication, among others, have emerged. Additionally, differences and similarities with findings from other studies have been indicated.",

abstract="Digital mapmaking has traditionally been a desktop computing activity with dedicated graphical (native or web) applications that strongly depend on the precision of mouse input. In addition, digital mapmaking also has a strong pillar on field observations, which have remained a separate task to the final mapmaking. In this work, we present to users a mobile application that combines the strengths of graphical mapmaking user interfaces with the actual geographical context into an integrated and collaborative user interface. In particular, the application implements three representative mobile mapmaking tasks (path recording, path editing and path reviewing) and includes gamification elements. A field experiment was conducted with thirty-six participants for two twenty-day periods during which they were asked to provide information about the pedestrian network of an urban region using the app. The results from questionnaire responses and contribution data showed that most users prefer recording their path, which is also the work with the lowest interaction. Moreover, gamification did not bring the expected results and the more difficult tasks were undertaken by few devoted users. Further research is needed to examine how interface design could better engage committed users in the aforementioned mapmaking task types.",

Previous work has not considered playful learning of difficult content, such as the Carbohydrate Counting Method, which involves counting the number of carbohydrate grams in a meal and matching that to the appropriate dose of insulin in order to manage the blood glucose levels. Sugar Mario was designed to have a familiar and simple gameplay based on classical platform video games, such as Super Mario, Donkey Kong, and other similar games. The carbohydrate counting method was seamlessly integrated in the gameplay in order to provide an educating, entertaining, and compelling experience to diabetics of all ages, even family members and friends. Our implementation suggests that a classic and engaging platform video game is malleable to the infusion of serious content without significant dilution of the gameplay. Notably, a diabetic person has designed Sugar Mario and the source code has been shared online for inspection and contribution by interested parties.},

  abstract={The proliferation of smartphones with video recording and action cameras has empowered users to effortlessly capture everyday moments and activities in video format. This process often results into long video sequences that need to be edited down and summarized in order to be properly archived, shared within social media, or simply projected to family and friends. For those who do not possess video-editing skills, isolating the most appropriate moments is a difficult and time-consuming task. This work presents "ActionTrip", a system that provides gestural user interaction during video-capture, in order to seamlessly tag personal points of interest. In addition, the system captures contextual information about nearby landmarks and information from social networking systems. This combination of personal with social preferences has enabled a single-step final editing process, which presents to the user a small list of points interest (public landmarks and personal preferences), instead of the actual recorded video that might be very long to comprehend. The benefits of this system have been demonstrated through a small-scale case study during the visit and tour in a European city.},

  abstract={Contemporary research has introduced educational robotics in the classroom, but there are few studies about the effects of alternative embodied interaction modalities on computational thinking and science education. Twenty-six middle school students were asked to program interfaces for controlling the heading and speed of a robot using two types of embodied interaction modalities. We compared touch and full-body gestures to autonomous control, which does not require any embodied interaction. We assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the projects they created during a problem-solving task and examined their understandings of science concepts related to kinematics. We found that novice students preferred full-body interfaces, while advanced students moved to more disembodied and abstract computational thinking. These findings might be applied to focus computing and science education activities to the right age and abilities groups of students.},

We measured students' preferences, views, and intentions. Further- more, we evaluated students' interaction modalities selections during a semi- open problem-solving task.

representations and tangible interactive objects benefit learning especially for young students. In this work, we explore the
benefits of learning to code for ubiquitous computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for
the desktop computer. For this purpose, thirty-six students participated in a within groups study that involved three types of
tangibility at the target computer platform: 1) desktop with Scratch, 2) wearable with Arduino LilyPad, and 3) robotic with
Lego Mindstorms. Regardless of the target platform, we employed the same desktop visual programming environment (MIT Scratch,
Modkit and Enchanting) and we measured emotional engagement and assessed students' programming skills. We found that students
expressed more positive emotions while programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible
computing platforms didn't affect dramatically students' performance in computational thinking.},

increases, the nearer from the bottom left of the screen this chord is to be applied. Notably, our results give evidence of the
fact that there is a threshold (five-finger-chord) beyond which the above relation is not strong.},

equivalent groups of twenty. The first group played the game, the second engaged with re-designing and modifying the game and
the third (control) group solved the same exercises (with the educational game) on paper. The results showed that the making
group exhibits certain attitudinal benefits. Hence, our findings suggest that learning through games should include more than
just playing a well-designed game, it should also consider the involvement of students with various making affordances.},

research has developed and evaluated several visual programming tools that are suitable for computer education in schools.
However, little is known about how pedagogic styles affect student attitudes towards learning computer programming. This paper
reports on a preliminary study on the influence of alternative teaching styles on student's enjoyment and attitude towards
computing. Two groups of twelve students each were asked to revise a computer game. The traditional instruction group was
provided with detailed information, while the encouragement group was asked to help the teacher to change the variables of the
game. The results indicate that an encouraging pedagogic style promotes more positive attitudes towards computer programming
and more self-confidence than traditional instruction. Further research should repeat the experiment across several weeks for
more programming concepts and should also assess the cognitive benefits.},

views and the duration of a video message significantly depend on the gender of the viewer and creator. Most notably, girls
created more messages, but boys viewed their own messages more. Finally, there are video messages with numerous views, which
indicates that some videos have content qualities beyond the communication message itself. Overall, the practical implications

Previous research in user-based techniques has assumed an extra effort from the users, such as video replies, comments, tags,
and annotations. We have developed and evaluated the SocialSkip system, which improves sense making of web videos by
visualizing the simplest form of user interactions with video, such as pause, and seek. In contrast to previous stand-alone
implementations, the SocialSkip system employs a web-video player and cloud-based resources (application logic, database,
content). The system was validated with two user studies, which provided several hundreds of user interactions with five types
of web video (sports, comedy, lecture, documentary, how-to). We found that seeking activity within web video is reversely
proportional to how interesting the video is. Moreover, we suggest that if the users are actively seeking for information
within a video (e.g., lecture, how-to), then the user activity graph could be associated with the semantics of the video.
Finally, SocialSkip provides an open architecture for collaborative contributions to the analysis of the user activity data, in
a fashion similar to the TRECVID workshop series.},

strategies in the MT condition, such as bi-manual input. The proposed tasks and the results support the use of MT in

touching multiple fingers simultaneously on any place of the display. Previous research on multi-touch toolkits has provided
basic access to touch events, but there is no support for advanced user interface widgets, such as chords. For this purpose, we
extended the open-source PyMT toolkit with an architecture that supports alternative user interaction strategies with chorded
menus. In addition, we built a multi-user extension that supports chords for two or more users. Chords could be used for having
user-aware MT applications. Our toolkit is open source and has been designed as a widget that could be integrated into broader
interaction frameworks for multi-touch screens.},

Social Network Surfing, Wasting Time, Using Applications. Finally, the results were analyzed in order to interpret each
factor's impact and to enable a comparison with previous research regarding the same subject. These showed how users continue
to primarily regard Facebook as a means of socializing with other users, but also the extent to which Facebook has become a
part of their daily routine, something that is indicated by the impact of the "Wasting Time" factor. Further research can be
conducted by addressing a greater number of users, selected with a less random manner and possibly with a different (cultural,

Previous works on social television systems belong to two categories: 1) studies on how collocated groups of viewers socialize
while watching TV, and 2) studies on novel Social TV applications (e.g. experimental set-ups) and devices (e.g. ambient
displays) that provide technological support for TV sociability over a distance. The main shortcoming of those studies is that
they have not considered the dominant contemporary method of Social TV. Early adopters of technology have been watching and
sharing video online. We employed cultural probes in order to gain in-depth information about the social aspect of video
sharing on the internet. Our sample consisted of six heavy users of internet video, watching an average of at least one hour of
internet video a day. In particular, we explored how they are integrating video into their daily social communication
practices. We found that internet video is shared and discussed with distant friends. Moreover, the results of the study
indicate several opportunities and threats for the development of integrated mass and interpersonal communication applications

interactive TV as content creation, 2) interactive TV as a content and experience sharing process, and 3) interactive TV as
control of audiovisual content. We propose this simple taxonomy (create-share-control) as an evolutionary step over the

television use as a secondary function to other activities, such as socializing, domestic chores, leisure pursuits. For this
purpose, the requirements for ambient user interactivity with TV are organized in a small set of design principles. The design
principles have been selected, analyzed and synthesized from readings in previous works on media and ethnographic studies about
television, and everyday life. It is suggested that universal access in ambient intelligence is promoted by considering design
principles such as opportunistic interaction, user participation, group interactions, and multiple levels of attention to the
user interface. Finally, the principles have been tested in the design of a user interface for interactive music television.
This preliminary case suggests that the proposed principles facilitate the design of user interfaces that blend seamlessly with

with an application to accomplish a particular goal. The emergence of media-rich computer-mediated leisure applications
requires a fresh view of the current paradigms and a careful examination of how this change of perspective affects their
relevance. This paper proposes a metaphor for accessing personalized television programming and suggests an approach for
integrating the metaphor into the design of a television user interface. The proposed metaphor is tested in the design of a
personalized advertising service. The results of the empirical research are discussed and the suitability of the metaphor for
other television programs is examined.},

television, because it is adapted to fundamentally different user aspirations and activities. Instead, the virtual channel is
proposed as a model that explains the proper design of user access to personalized television programming. The virtual channel
is a model that aids the organization and dynamic presentation of television programming from a combination of live broadcasts,
prerecorded content and Internet resources at each set-top box. In this paper, we describe two applications that have been used
to validate the virtual channel model. We have employed the properties of the virtual channel model into the design of
personalized television advertising and interactive music video clip programming. Finally, we describe an ActiveX control that
implements a core set of the virtual channels features.},

lead to a paradigm shift in the way advertising is developed, conducted, and analysed. Interactive TV, combines the appeal and
mass audience of traditional TV with the interactive features such as those currently available on the Web and offers new
possibilities for the viewer, who can directly access relevant information and other services being just one-click away. In
this context, personalisation of advertisements refers to the use of technology and viewer information in order to tailor
commercials and their respective interactive content to each individual viewer profile. In this paper we deal with the topic of
advertising over digital interactive TV and describe a specific approach to the delivery of personalised interactive
advertisement content to viewers based on their individual profile, focusing on the necessary architecture, mechanisms and user
interface issues which reveal a challenging research domain.},

Targeted Advertising in a Digital TV Environment. iMEDIA covers the need of Advertising Companies to identify broad classes of
TV viewers who will respond similarly to marketing actions, and thus develop their target advertising techniques. The consumers
are equipped with a settop box (STB) with storage facilities and a modem. The definition of consumer profiles and clusters is
based on demographics, preferences, and analysis of the consumer interactions with the TV, which are tracked automatically. In
order to protect consumers' identities, consumer data are stored locally on the STB and the classification of a consumer in a
specific cluster takes place at the client side. Consumer data from the consumers, who permit it, is periodically transferred
to the Server where Data Mining techniques are applied. The extracted consumer behavioral rules associate the clusters with
consumer profiles and interaction/navigational data and are sent through the broadcast channel to the consumers' STBs for the
classification of each consumer and the playback of the advertisements that match consumer interests.},

as iTV, combines the appeal and mass audience of traditional TV with the interactive features such as those currently available
on the Web. Although personalisation is a practice used widely on the Internet by many sites, applying personalisation
techniques over interactive television presents a number of difficulties. In this paper we focus on the design and testing
process of the User Interface (UI) for the Interactive {\&} Personalized Advertisement TV viewer. We argue that there are a lot
of challenges involved in the designing of interactive TV applications. These are related with the differences of the medium
from the traditional PC based Information Systems in terms of input and output devices, viewing environment, number of users
and low level of expertise in PC usage.},
