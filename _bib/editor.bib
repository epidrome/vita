  abstract      = {Every day we share encounters with others as we inhabit the space around us. In offering insights and
knowledge on this increasingly important topic, this book introduces a range of empirical and theoretical approaches to the
study of shared encounters. It highlights the multifaceted nature of collective experience and provides a deeper understanding
of the nature and value of shared encounters in everyday life.Divided into four sections, each section comprises a set of
chapters on a different topic and is introduced by a key author in the field who provides an overview of the content. The book
itself is introduced by Paul Dourish, who sets the theme of shared encounters in the context of technological and social change
over the last fifteen years. The four sections that follow consider the characteristics of shared encounters and describe how
they can be supported in different settings: the first section, introduced by Barry Brown, looks at shared experiences. George
Roussos, in the second section, presents playful encounters. Malcolm McCulloch introduces the section on spatial settings and '
last but not least ' Elizabeth Churchill previews the topic of social glue. The individual chapters that accompany each part
offer particular perspectives on the main topic and provide detailed insights from the author's own research background. A
valuable reference for anyone designing ubiquitous media, mobile social software and LBS applications, this volume will also be
useful to researchers, students and practitioners in fields ranging from computer science to urban studies.},
