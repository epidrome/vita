  abstract      = {Interactive TV research spans across a rather diverse body of scientific subfields. Research articles have
appeared in several venues, such as multimedia, HCI, CSCW, UIST, user modeling, media and communication sciences. In this
study, we explore the state-of-the-art and consider two basic issues: What is interactive TV research? Can it help us reinvent
the practices of authoring, delivering, and watching TV? For this purpose, we have reviewed the research literature, as well as
the industrial developments and identified three concepts that provide a high-level taxonomy of interactive TV research: (1)
content editing, (2) content sharing, and (3) content control. We propose this simple taxonomy (edit-share-control) as an
evolutionary step over the established hierarchical produce-deliver-consume paradigm. Moreover, we demonstrate how each
disciplinary effort has contributed to and why the full potential of interactive TV has not yet been fulfilled. Finally, we
describe how interdisciplinary approaches could provide solutions to some notable contemporary research issues.},

  abstract      = {This book is intended for those who design and build software systems for human-computer interaction. It is useful to both professionals and students of informatics, engineering and design courses, as well as related disciplines. Firstly, the reader learns about interaction design beyond simple usability and ergonomics. The reader will also learn about the engineering of the minimum feasible product and about collaborative systems. The book chapters contain biographies as well as research efforts and commercial case studies that refer to practical applications in areas of timely interest.},
