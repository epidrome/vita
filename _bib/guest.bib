Although there are many and diverse ways of designing learning videos, there is limited understanding of the efficacy and
usefulness of each method. Therefore, we survey the state-of-the-art in the design, development and evaluation of open and
video-based courses. The main objective is to highlight the importance and benefits of analytics and to support instructors
with the appropriate resources for improving the use of their courses. This can be achieved by combining and analyzing
learners' interactions with other available data obtained from learners, as such video analytics open new avenues for research
on open and video-based courses. In addition to the guidelines for video-based analytics we have selected five indicative
case-studies that provide in-depth analysis..},

applications for television. Contemporary infrastructures have been converging towards mature development platforms, but there

interactive TV, and we provide directions for further research in user experience design for TV Apps.},

eCommerce, eEducation, and digital entertainment. On the other hand, the advances in communication and micro-electronics have
led to a transition from traditional personal computer-centric to more intuitive human-centric information access modes and the
embedment of computer systems throughout the natural environment. This type of computation is generally known as Pervasive or
Ubiquitous Computing. It can also be referred to as ambient intelligence, or talking about media environments as ambient media.
It allows a person to use a variety of devices and sensor networks seamlessly embedded throughout our daily life, such as
personal digital assistant (PDA), smart electronics, sensors, as well as personal computer, to access those media contents. The
combination of these two trends (emergence of media and pervasive computing) holds the potential of providing a user with
seamless and ubiquitous access to rich and dynamic mul- timedia resources from anywhere and anytime.},

  abstract      = {At first glance, the notion of social interactive television seems to be a tautology. Television watching
has always been a social activity. People watch television together in their living rooms, and outside their homes they talk
about last night's football match; and even call each other to recommend an interesting program. Unfortunately, until recently,
research on social interactive television has been scarce. One limiting factor for the development of innovative services for
the home is the interactive technology behind user interaction, which was limited to the remote control. Fortunately, a number
of studies concentrate on extending interactive methods, for example by using contextual information. This article reviews the
state of the art in these two directions: the social aspects of television and user interaction. We conclude with a research
agenda for further research, which might transform current interactive television services into shared experiences.},

time, or asynchronous, which happens with a time difference. This article provides an overview of research findings and

  abstract      = {The introduction of mobile and broadband networks in complement to the existing satellite, cable, and
terrestrial platforms, opens new opportunities for interactive TV (ITV) applications. In addition, the widespread adoption of
multimedia computing has enabled the processing of TV content on personal devices such as mobile phones and PCs. The above
developments raise novel issues and require the adoption of new multimedia standards and application frameworks. In particular,
the explosion in the amount of available TV channels over digital television platforms (broadcast or internet protocol) makes
searching and locating interesting content a cumbersome task. In this context, personalization research is concerned with the
adaptation of content (e.g. movies, news, advertisements). Personalization is achieved with the employment of algorithms and
data collection schemes that predict and recommend to television viewers content that match their interests. In addition, the
distribution of TV content to mobile devices over broadband wireless raises the issue of video quality. Video quality depends
on many aspects of the video encoding systems, such as bit rate and algorithms that model human perception of video on small
screens. In this article, we examine contemporary research in personalized and mobile digital TV applications. Moreover, we
present a critical survey of the most prominent research and provide directions for further research in personalized and mobile
digital TV (DTV) applications.},
