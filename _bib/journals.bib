  abstract={Although digital storytelling bears significant benefits for older users, much remains to be explored regarding their psychosocial attributes that could affect technology acceptance. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is one of the most influential theoretical frameworks in the field and since its first introduction, there have been numerous studies upon its potential modifications throughout different cultures. Based on three factors that have been extensively depicted in age-related literature (chronological age, loneliness, and future time perspective), in this research, we designed a TAM extension in order to gain insights on the elements that influence Greek older adults’ intentions to use online storytelling applications. Through a quantitative approach, we evaluated the proposed model with data collected from 112 participants. Due to our results, TAM has been validated as a robust model, future time perspective had a positive influence on perceived ease of use, while age and loneliness had no statistically significant effect.},

 abstract={Contemporary research has explored educational robotics, but it has not examined the development of computational thinking in the context of programming embodied interactions. Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures. We measured students’ perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task. We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment.},

ABSTRACT = {The design of educational serious games to be used as motivational learning environments is very rewarding but also very challenging. The integration of learning with playing activities seems to be one of the major challenges. Previous work has not examined the integration of science content based on the school curriculum in the gameplay mechanics of a computer role playing game (CRPG) and in a storyline which ends with a dramatic conflict. In this study, an educational CRPG was designed for learning concepts in the physical sciences according to the curriculum of the correspondent book. We integrated the content into the gameplay which included several tasks to be performed and puzzles to be solved, advancing players to successfully complete the game, according to the game&rsquo;s storyline. Finally, we performed a usability test for ease-of-use and enjoyment issues. Most testers considered the educational CRPG entertaining. Computer role playing game&rsquo;s gameplay mechanics provide affordances for the integration of science and technology courses in a playful learning environment.},

abstract = { Purpose This study aims to explore the effects of an alternative learning environment, such as the video game making (VGM) within science content, on computational thinking (CT) skills development and student performance. Design/methodology/approach A didactic intervention was performed for five weeks. Two student groups were taught the same computational concepts in two ways. One group was taught by constructing a video game within science content to practice science and computing curriculum while the other group constructed appropriately designed projects to practice only the computing curriculum. Additionally, the students constructed a pretest project before the beginning of the intervention and a post-test project after its end. Results were based on quantitative and qualitative code analysis and interviews from the students. Findings VGM within science content resulted in projects with more CT skills and also supported students to effectively apply their acquired coding skills, after the end of the intervention. Practical implications The results of this study suggest an interdisciplinary environment, such as the VGM within science content, which can effectively support CT skills development and computing curriculum. Originality/value Although VGM has been successfully applied to teach science content, this study explored the potential influence of this learning environment on CT skills development and coding fluency. Such interdisciplinary educational environments could be applied in the typical school settings to promote a plethora of skills and academic contents. }

abstract={Embodied interaction with tangible interactive objects can be beneficial for introducing abstract scientific concepts, especially for young learners. Nevertheless, there is limited comparative evaluation of alternative interaction modalities with contemporary educational technology, such as tablets and robots. In this study, we explore the effects of touch and gestural interaction with a tablet and a robot, in the context of a primary education physics course about the notion of friction. For this purpose, 56 students participated in a between-groups study that involved four computationally enhanced interventions which correspond to different input and output modalities, respectively: (1) touch-virtual, (2) touch-physical, (3) hand gesture-virtual, and (4) hand gesture-physical. We measured students' friction knowledge and examined their views. We found that the physical conditions had greater learning impact concerning friction knowledge compared to the virtual way. Additionally, physical manipulation benefited those learners who had misconceptions or limited initial knowledge about friction. We also found that students who used the more familiar touchscreen interface demonstrated similar learning gains and reported higher usability compared to those using the hand-tilt interface. These findings suggest that user interface familiarity should be carefully balanced with user interface congruency, in order to establish accessibility to a scientific concept in a primary education context.},

In practice, the presentation style of video lectures ranges from a direct recording of classroom teaching with a stationary camera and screencasts with voice-over, up to highly elaborate video post-production. Previous work evaluated the effectiveness of several presentation styles, but there has not been any consistent taxonomy, which would have made comparisons and meta-analyses possible. In this article, we surveyed the research literature and we examined contemporary video-based courses, which have been produced by diverse educational organizations and teachers across various academic disciplines. We organized video lectures in two dimensions according to the level of human presence and according to the type of instructional media. In addition to organizing existing video lectures in a comprehensive way, the proposed taxonomy offers a design space that facilitates the choice of a suitable presentation style, as well as the preparation of new ones.},

abstract = {Objectives Exergames can replace sedentary time spent on computer gaming with physical activity. Previous research has found exergaming to elicit light-to-moderate exercise intensity. Our primary aim was to examine the exercise intensity of a newly developed biking exergame. Methods Eight males (23.9±0.6 years) played the exergame (PLAY) and walked (WALK) on three separate occasions, with the condition counterbalanced and in random sequence within each day. They were asked to PLAY and WALK for a minimum of 15 min and then continue for as long as they wanted. We measured heart rate (HR), activity duration, caloric expenditure and subject-rated exertion and enjoyment (based on 0–10 Visual Analogue Scale, VAS). We used an average of each outcome variable across the 3 days in the analysis. Results The average intensity during PLAY (73{\%}±10{\%} of HRmax) was significantly higher than that during WALK (57{\%}±7{\%} of HRmax, p=0.01). Participants spent 12.5±5.3 min at 80{\%}–89{\%} of HRmax and 5.5±4.6 min at ≥90{\%} of HRmax during PLAY, whereas intensity during WALK was ≤72{\%} of HRmax. The duration of PLAY was 44.3±0.7 min and of WALK 17.0±0.7 min (p=0.01). The relative energy expenditure during PLAY was 7.6±0.7 kcal/min and during WALK 6.2±0.3 kcal/min (p{\textless}0.01). The enjoyment of PLAY (VAS 8.7±0.1) was higher than that of WALK (VAS 3.9±1.8, p=0.01). Conclusions Exergaming can be an innovative way of enjoyable high-intensity training.},

We employed similar blocks-based visual programming environments, and we measured emotional engagement, attitudes, and computer programming performance. We found that students were more engaged by and had a higher intention of learning programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible computing platforms, either robot or wearable, did not affect the students’ performance in learning basic computational concepts (e.g., sequence, repeat, and decision). Our findings suggest that computer programming should be introduced through multiple target platforms (e.g., robots, smartphones, wearables) to engage children.},

In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection. The visualization of the pedestrian-generated data on a map required a partially manual process, thus, further research should explore the gamification of the data visualization part, too.},

that all users perform exactly the same task (e.g., moving and resizing photos), or that they negotiate individual actions in
turns. However, there is limited user interface software that supports simultaneous performance of individual actions during
shared tasks (Fig. 1a). As a remedy, we have introduced multi-touch chords (Fig. 1b) and personal action windows (Fig. 1c) for
co-located collaboration on a large multi-touch vertical display. Instead of selecting an item in a fixed menu by reaching for
it, users work simultaneously on shared tasks by means of personal action windows, which are triggered by multi-touch chords
performed anywhere on the display. In order to evaluate the proposed technique with users, we introduced an experimental task,
which stands for the group dynamics that emerge during shared tasks on a large display. A grounded theory analysis of users'
behaviour provided insights into established co-located collaboration topics, such as conflict resolution strategies and space
negotiation. The main contribution of this work is the design and implementation of a novel seamless identification and
interaction technique that supports diverse multi-touch interactions by multiple users: multi-touch chord interaction along

that learning performance progress was slightly improved and stabilized after the third week of the video-assisted course. We
also found that attitudes regarding easiness, usability, usefulness, and acceptance of this type of course remained at the same

as comments, tags, and annotations. Moreover, some of the user-centric approaches imposed an extra effort to the users in order
to capture required information. In this research, we are describing a method for the analysis of implicit users' interactions
with a web video player, such as pause, play, and thirty-seconds skip or rewind. The results of our experiments indicated that
even the simple user heuristic of local maxima might effectively detect the same video-events, as indicated manually. Notably,
the proposed technique was more accurate in the detection of events that have a short duration, because those events motivated

games, 3) engage students into constructive trial and error game-play and 4) situate collaborative learning. As illustrated
examples we designed two math video games targeted to primary education students. The gameplay of the math video games embeds
addition operations in a seamless way, which has been inspired by that of classic platform games. In this way, the students are
adding numbers as part of popular gameplay mechanics and as a means to reach the video game objective, rather than as an end in
itself. The employment of well-defined principles in the design of math video games should facilitate the evaluation of
learning effectiveness by researchers. Moreover, educators can deploy alternative versions of the games in order to engage
students with diverse learning styles. For example, some students might be motived and benefited by narrative, while others by
collaboration, because it is unlikely that one type of serious video game might fit all learning styles. The proposed
principles are not meant to be an exhaustive list, but a starting point for extending the list and applying them in other cases
of serious video games beyond mathematics and learning.},

end, experimentation is based on users' interactions (e.g., pause, seek/scrub) that have been gathered in a controlled user
experiment with information-rich videos. Collective information seeking behavior is then modeled by means of the corresponding
probability distribution function. Thus, it is argued that the bell-shaped reference patterns are shown to significantly

  abstract      = {A diverse user population employs interactive TV (ITV) applications in a leisure context for entertainment
purposes. The traditional user interface (UI) evaluation paradigm involving efficiency and task completion may not be adequate
for the assessment of such applications. In this paper, we argue that unless ITV applications are evaluated with consideration
for the ordinary TV viewer, they are going to be appropriate only for the computer literate user, thus excluding the TV
audience from easy access to information society services. The field of media studies has accumulated an extensive theory of TV
and associated methods. We applied the corresponding findings in the domain of ITV to examine how universal access to ITV
applications can be obtained. By combining these results with emerging affective quality theories for interactive products, we
propose a UI evaluation framework for ITV applications.},

been well-received by end-users. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of an animated character for presenting
information and navigating music videos within an interactive television (ITV) application. Information was displayed over
music video clips with two alternative user interfaces: 1) semi-transparent information overlays, 2) an animated character. For
this purpose, the differences between ITV and desktop computing motivated the adaptation of the traditional usability
evaluation techniques. The evaluation revealed that users reported higher affective quality with the animated character user
interface. Although the success of animated characters in desktop productivity applications has been limited, there is growing
evidence that animated characters might be viable in a domestic environment for leisure activities, such as interactive TV.},

quality control from the television producers. Besides the technical issues, interactive computer graphics for television
should be evaluated by television viewers. We employ an animated character in an interactive music television application that
was evaluated by consumers, and was developed using the Virtual Channel Control Library, a custom high-level API, that was
built using Microsoft Windows and TV technologies.},
