  abstract      = {There is a growing number and variety of educational video lectures online, but there is limited
understanding of their effectiveness in terms of learning and usability. Although there is significant research literature
within the individual domains of usability and of video learning, there is limited understanding of their integrated design. In
particular, there is limited research on guidelines for usable video lecture design, such as the presence of humans in the
video and navigation support through the video. For example, it is established that learners benefit from highly structured
learning material, but the manual editing of video is not feasible for most learning organizations and instructors. In order to
accommodate this emerging instruction medium we are drawing design principles and models from the research literature on
educational technology and video interaction. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive approach to the design of usable video
lecture systems and content. Finally, we suggest that learning organizations and instructors should invest additional effort in
video systems that support an integrated approach to editing, sharing, and controlling of video lectures.},

  abstract      = {Every second millions of users enjoy content streaming on diverse video players (e.g., Web, Apps, social
networks) and create billions of interactions within online video, such as play, pause, seek/scrub. This collective
intelligence of video viewers might be leveraged into useful information for improved video navigation. For example, we can
accurately detect and retrieve interesting scenes through the analysis of the aggregated users' replay interactions with the
video player. Effective crowdsourcing of video interactions is grounded on previous work in multimedia, user modeling, and
controlled user experiments. These research issues are described for the case of user-based detection of video thumbnails that
stand for the semantics of the video. Moreover, we demonstrate the respective experimental environment with a focus on
educational and user generated (e.g., how-to, lecture) videos.},

  abstract      = {Processing, Arduino, and the growth of the associated communities of practice, also called maker
communities, has motivated a broader participation of non-technical users in the engineering of interactive systems. Besides
online sharing, maker communities meet regularly and share knowledge for various purposes (e.g., creative hacking, social
networking, lifelong learning). In the context of maker communities, the understanding of engineering interactive systems
(e.g., motivations, objectives, collaboration, process, reports) and the design of the respective tools (e.g., end-user
programming for artists, or children) are not well documented. As a remedy, we present a coherent overview of related work, as
well as our own experiences in the organization and running of maker workshops. The tutorial format (lecture and hands-on
workshop) benefits both practitioners and researchers with an understanding of creative software tools and practices. Moreover,
participants become familiar with the organization of maker workshops as 1) a research method for understanding users, 2) an
engineering process for interactive computer systems, and 3) a practice for teaching and learning.},

results in this multidisciplinary field. The review includes topics such as content distribution, system software of the
receivers, and user interaction. In addition, we will discuss current commercial events such as the next generation of optical
discs (e.g., blue-ray), BBC peer-to-peer service, and mobile television. Based on this discussion, we will formulate an agenda
for further research. The agenda includes, for example, end-user enrichment of television content and social television. This
half-day tutorial will provide the attendee a solid understanding of the technologies currently in use and an introduction of
the open questions in the field.},
