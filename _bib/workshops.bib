  title={Softwork: What are humans useful for?},
  abstract={In this article, we suggest that the use of software applications has already provided a perpetually robust solution to the problem of work, employment, and jobs. We assume that basic human needs
(food, shelter, security) have been fulfilled and we aim to address self-actualization. For this purpose, we employ social phenomenol- ogy theory and we regard human actions and beliefs as a malleable inter-subjective reality. In particular, we focus on the genre of office productivity software and we provide a case study on Computer- Aided Design (CAD) software. We demonstrate how the work of the architect has gradually morphed from a skillful, embodied, and en- acted activity into mere symbol manipulation that can be performed by unskilled humans. We suggest that this finding can be generalized to the majority of software applications that have a similar workflow, which includes editing of content and sharing it with other human beings, in a self- reinforcing cycle. These findings have significant im- plications for policy, education, and spirituality, which are malleable and could shape human needs in alignment with any goal that we consider as good.},

  title={Immortality and resurrection of the digital self},
  abstract={We can safely predict that sometime in the future there will be more social media profiles belonging to dead than living people. In this work, we begin by characterizing the cultural meaning of the technological affordances that social media institutions have already associated with profiles that belong to dead people. We analyze current practices and we present future trends under the scope of the remediation theory 1, which suggests that at least initially, new media practices are just a mimesis of existing practices. In particular, we examine Facebook, which has already introduced several options for user profiles that belong to dead users. Finally, we raise awareness about novel technological and cultural issues that have been neglected or are not in the interests of social media institutions.},

always without challenges for the average user. Although, the use of single-touch is very common, interaction design have yet
to be examined thoroughly by taking into account potential differences of single and multi-touch functionality. In this work,
we investigate the potential of a two-finger chord button in comparison to the traditional single touch buttons that we find in
touchscreens. Based on the fact that users are familiar with single touch buttons (even before the MT screens) our hypotheses
are: the use of a two finger chord button a) decreases users' efficiency, and b) delays users' responses. In order to
investigate our hypotheses, we conducted a controlled experiment with 12 users working on an appropriately designed MT
application. The empirical results have indicated that the use of two-finger button significantly delays users' response-time
while it does not affect users' efficiency on the performed task.},

measured the distance covered for each one of the workouts. We found that augmented feedback from mobile self-tracking devices
can promote working out, but there is also a trade-off of increased anxiety and disorientation. Thus, we suggest that sports
tracking software should be modest about how much and what type of visual information it provides to the user. In particular,
we found that the only piece of visual information that had an impact on performance was average speed, which indicates a
connection with gamication. Further research should consider additional levels of gamification beyond score, such as graphics,

method, which analyzes implicit user interactions within web video, such as rewind. In particular, we have modeled the user
information seeking behavior as a time series and the semantic regions as a discrete pulse of fixed width. We constructed these
pulses from user interactions with a documentary video that has a very rich visual style with too many cuts and camera
angles/frames for the same scene. Next, we calculated the correlation coefficient between dynamically detected user pulses at
the local maximums and the reference pulse. We have found when people are actively seeking for information in a video, their
activity (these pulses) significantly matches the semantics of the video. This proposed pulse analysis method complements
previous work in content-based information retrieval and provides an additional user-based dimension for modeling the semantics
of a web video.},

environmental issues. We study this relationship in the context of an art installation that concerns the water cycle in nature.
The research question is: How can we design and evaluate software that becomes a medium to engage and inform the user? We have
gathered empirical data during a two days exhibition of two versions of a pervasive art installation by: observations,
questionnaires, and input logs. Data analysis reveals that the art installation engaged users, with focus on young children,
and communicated the intended message. The results are organized according to five important factors for developing and
evaluating interacting art installations. These are: 1) data collection method; 2) user interaction; 3) social interaction; 4)
issues about children; 5) message comprehension. We suggest that these factors can inform engineering practices for engaging
software like video-games.},

improve the mathematical skills of players. The game has a plot, featuring a story in which a mission is assigned to the
player. The story and the mission are used to stimulate the students' interest and motivate them to play the game. The
empirical study is a controlled experiment to which 46 Gymnasium (middle school) students participated. Results confirmed the
positive effects of the enjoyment on students' intention to use storytelling serious games. Notably, we found that gender has a
moderating effect on the relationships between enjoyment and intention to use the game. The results of this study suggest that
games with a storytelling component might be attractive to girls.},

appreciated in multi-user scenarios? Previous research has raised and considered the above research issues and questions for

enduring and meaningful exchanges. Shared encounters are the glue of social networks and have a socializing effect in terms of
mutual understanding, empathy, respect and thus tolerance towards others. The quality and characteristics of such encounters
are affected by the setting, or situation in which they occur. In a world shaped by communication technologies, non-place-based
networks often coexist alongside to the traditional local face-to-face social networks. As these multiple and distinct on and
off-line communities tend to carry out their activities in more and more distinct and sophisticated spaces, a lack of coherency
and fragmentation emerges in the sense of a shared space of community. Open public space with its streets, parks and squares
plays an important role in providing space for shared encounters among and between these coexisting networks. Mobile and
ubiquitous technologies enable social encounters located in public space, albeit not confined to fixed settings, whilst also
offering sharing of experiences from non-place based networks. We will look at how to create or support the conditions for
meaningful and persisting shared encounters. In particular we propose to explore how technologies can be appropriated for
shared interactions that can occur spontaneously and playfully and in doing so re-inhabit and connect place-based social
networks.},
