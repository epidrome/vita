abstract="New technologies and media aim at triggering student interest in mathematics and at making learning an entertaining process. However, playful math games need to provide learners with a better experience, which is connected with an engaging gameplay. Popular game mechanics could be used in order to integrate learning in the playing activities. This research employs the Super Mario game format for the design of a playful educational serious game in the context of math education. Mario Maths is addressed to students of 12 and 13 years old and aims to the practice of divisibility criteria. Mario collects numbers instead of coins that must be exactly divided with the number - target, avoiding or eliminating the wrong answers. A wrong choice transports Mario to a subterranean world which informs him for his mistake, but with no influence on the final goal achievement according to a constructive error and trial method. In the end of each track, the player is taking feedback of his effort in a self-assessment process. Mario Maths was developed to be used as a complementary educational tool for students who might be attracted from such forms of media. (https://github.com/ionio-seriousgames/mario-maths).",

abstract="While digital technology adoption by older adults rises constantly, the design of new technologies often overlooks the culture of the end users, which, in turn, has an impact on the acceptance and use by many of them. Based on the fact that technology adoption by this age group in Greece remains low, compared to the vast majority of the EU countries, our goal in this paper is to gain further insights into the user requirements of older adults as web 2.0 storytellers in order for designers to better address their needs. For this purpose, we implemented participatory design with five older adults in Greece over a twelve-week period, combined with an evolutionary prototyping approach, as we noticed during our sessions that our participants had a difficulty in envisioning and proposing novel technologies. In order to analyze and interpret the feedback that we collected during the design sessions, the digital storytelling sessions and the in-depth interviews, we made use of the Activity Theory, as well as age-related and self-presentation frameworks. Through probing our participants' usage and design preferences of the storytelling platform, we came up with a set of attributes and motives that seem to expound their online choices. Issues of loneliness and social inclusion, generativity and computer mediated communication, among others, have emerged. Additionally, differences and similarities with findings from other studies have been indicated.",

abstract="Digital mapmaking has traditionally been a desktop computing activity with dedicated graphical (native or web) applications that strongly depend on the precision of mouse input. In addition, digital mapmaking also has a strong pillar on field observations, which have remained a separate task to the final mapmaking. In this work, we present to users a mobile application that combines the strengths of graphical mapmaking user interfaces with the actual geographical context into an integrated and collaborative user interface. In particular, the application implements three representative mobile mapmaking tasks (path recording, path editing and path reviewing) and includes gamification elements. A field experiment was conducted with thirty-six participants for two twenty-day periods during which they were asked to provide information about the pedestrian network of an urban region using the app. The results from questionnaire responses and contribution data showed that most users prefer recording their path, which is also the work with the lowest interaction. Moreover, gamification did not bring the expected results and the more difficult tasks were undertaken by few devoted users. Further research is needed to examine how interface design could better engage committed users in the aforementioned mapmaking task types.",

Sugar Mario was designed to have a familiar and simple gameplay based on classical platform video games, such as Super Mario, Donkey Kong, and other similar games. The carbohydrate counting method was seamlessly integrated in the gameplay in order to provide an educating, entertaining, and compelling experience to diabetics of all ages, even family members and friends.

 abstract={Contemporary research has explored educational robotics, but it has not examined the development of computational thinking in the context of programming embodied interactions. Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures. We measured students’ perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task. We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment.},

ABSTRACT = {The design of educational serious games to be used as motivational learning environments is very rewarding but also very challenging. The integration of learning with playing activities seems to be one of the major challenges. Previous work has not examined the integration of science content based on the school curriculum in the gameplay mechanics of a computer role playing game (CRPG) and in a storyline which ends with a dramatic conflict. In this study, an educational CRPG was designed for learning concepts in the physical sciences according to the curriculum of the correspondent book. We integrated the content into the gameplay which included several tasks to be performed and puzzles to be solved, advancing players to successfully complete the game, according to the game&rsquo;s storyline. Finally, we performed a usability test for ease-of-use and enjoyment issues. Most testers considered the educational CRPG entertaining. Computer role playing game&rsquo;s gameplay mechanics provide affordances for the integration of science and technology courses in a playful learning environment.},

abstract = { Purpose This study aims to explore the effects of an alternative learning environment, such as the video game making (VGM) within science content, on computational thinking (CT) skills development and student performance. Design/methodology/approach A didactic intervention was performed for five weeks. Two student groups were taught the same computational concepts in two ways. One group was taught by constructing a video game within science content to practice science and computing curriculum while the other group constructed appropriately designed projects to practice only the computing curriculum. Additionally, the students constructed a pretest project before the beginning of the intervention and a post-test project after its end. Results were based on quantitative and qualitative code analysis and interviews from the students. Findings VGM within science content resulted in projects with more CT skills and also supported students to effectively apply their acquired coding skills, after the end of the intervention. Practical implications The results of this study suggest an interdisciplinary environment, such as the VGM within science content, which can effectively support CT skills development and computing curriculum. Originality/value Although VGM has been successfully applied to teach science content, this study explored the potential influence of this learning environment on CT skills development and coding fluency. Such interdisciplinary educational environments could be applied in the typical school settings to promote a plethora of skills and academic contents. }

abstract={Embodied interaction with tangible interactive objects can be beneficial for introducing abstract scientific concepts, especially for young learners. Nevertheless, there is limited comparative evaluation of alternative interaction modalities with contemporary educational technology, such as tablets and robots. In this study, we explore the effects of touch and gestural interaction with a tablet and a robot, in the context of a primary education physics course about the notion of friction. For this purpose, 56 students participated in a between-groups study that involved four computationally enhanced interventions which correspond to different input and output modalities, respectively: (1) touch-virtual, (2) touch-physical, (3) hand gesture-virtual, and (4) hand gesture-physical. We measured students' friction knowledge and examined their views. We found that the physical conditions had greater learning impact concerning friction knowledge compared to the virtual way. Additionally, physical manipulation benefited those learners who had misconceptions or limited initial knowledge about friction. We also found that students who used the more familiar touchscreen interface demonstrated similar learning gains and reported higher usability compared to those using the hand-tilt interface. These findings suggest that user interface familiarity should be carefully balanced with user interface congruency, in order to establish accessibility to a scientific concept in a primary education context.},

   abstract={The proliferation of smartphones with video recording and action cameras has empowered users to effortlessly capture everyday moments and activities in video format. This process often results into long video sequences that need to be edited down and summarized in order to be properly archived, shared within social media, or simply projected to family and friends. For those who do not possess video-editing skills, isolating the most appropriate moments is a difficult and time-consuming task. This work presents "ActionTrip", a system that provides gestural user interaction during video-capture, in order to seamlessly tag personal points of interest. In addition, the system captures contextual information about nearby landmarks and information from social networking systems. This combination of personal with social preferences has enabled a single-step final editing process, which presents to the user a small list   of points interest (public landmarks and personal preferences), instead of the actual recorded video that might be very long to comprehend. The benefits of this system have been demonstrated through a small-scale case study during the visit and tour in a European city.},

abstract = {Objectives Exergames can replace sedentary time spent on computer gaming with physical activity. Previous research has found exergaming to elicit light-to-moderate exercise intensity. Our primary aim was to examine the exercise intensity of a newly developed biking exergame. Methods Eight males (23.9±0.6 years) played the exergame (PLAY) and walked (WALK) on three separate occasions, with the condition counterbalanced and in random sequence within each day. They were asked to PLAY and WALK for a minimum of 15 min and then continue for as long as they wanted. We measured heart rate (HR), activity duration, caloric expenditure and subject-rated exertion and enjoyment (based on 0–10 Visual Analogue Scale, VAS). We used an average of each outcome variable across the 3 days in the analysis. Results The average intensity during PLAY (73{\%}±10{\%} of HRmax) was significantly higher than that during WALK (57{\%}±7{\%} of HRmax, p=0.01). Participants spent 12.5±5.3 min at 80{\%}–89{\%} of HRmax and 5.5±4.6 min at ≥90{\%} of HRmax during PLAY, whereas intensity during WALK was ≤72{\%} of HRmax. The duration of PLAY was 44.3±0.7 min and of WALK 17.0±0.7 min (p=0.01). The relative energy expenditure during PLAY was 7.6±0.7 kcal/min and during WALK 6.2±0.3 kcal/min (p{\textless}0.01). The enjoyment of PLAY (VAS 8.7±0.1) was higher than that of WALK (VAS 3.9±1.8, p=0.01). Conclusions Exergaming can be an innovative way of enjoyable high-intensity training.},

In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection. The visualization of the pedestrian-generated data on a map required a partially manual process, thus, further research should explore the gamification of the data visualization part, too.},

with the use of a video game. Our findings suggest that video game pedagogy could provide malleable learning for different
groups of students using methods that move beyond the conventional tool-based approach.},

  abstract      = {Co-located collaboration on large vertical screens has become technically feasible, but users are faced with
increased effort, or have to wear intrusive personal identifiers. Previous research on co-located collaboration has assumed
that all users perform exactly the same task (e.g., moving and resizing photos), or that they negotiate individual actions in
turns. However, there is limited user interface software that supports simultaneous performance of individual actions during
shared tasks (Fig. 1a). As a remedy, we have introduced multi-touch chords (Fig. 1b) and personal action windows (Fig. 1c) for
co-located collaboration on a large multi-touch vertical display. Instead of selecting an item in a fixed menu by reaching for
it, users work simultaneously on shared tasks by means of personal action windows, which are triggered by multi-touch chords
performed anywhere on the display. In order to evaluate the proposed technique with users, we introduced an experimental task,
which stands for the group dynamics that emerge during shared tasks on a large display. A grounded theory analysis of users'
behaviour provided insights into established co-located collaboration topics, such as conflict resolution strategies and space
negotiation. The main contribution of this work is the design and implementation of a novel seamless identification and
interaction technique that supports diverse multi-touch interactions by multiple users: multi-touch chord interaction along
with personal action windows.},

open-source project and we have been operating an open service that detects flu-related symptoms and shares the data in
real-time with anyone who wants to built upon this system. An analysis of a small number of precisely geo-located status
updates (e.g. Twitter) correlates closely with the Google Flu Trends and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
flu-positive reports. We suggest that public health information systems should embrace an open- source approach and offer
linked data, in order to facilitate the development of an ecosystem of applications and services, and in order to be
transparent to the general public interest.},

Nevertheless, the execution of computer programs usually takes place on a traditional desktop computer, which has a limited
repertoire of input and output interfaces to engage with the user. On the other hand, pedagogy has emphasized that physical
representations and tangible interactive objects benefit learning especially for young students. In this work, we explore the
benefits of learning to code for ubiquitous computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for
the desktop computer. For this purpose, thirty-six students participated in a within groups study that involved three types of
tangibility at the target computer platform: 1) desktop with Scratch, 2) wearable with Arduino LilyPad, and 3) robotic with
Lego Mindstorms. Regardless of the target platform, we employed the same desktop visual programming environment (MIT Scratch,
Modkit and Enchanting) and we measured emotional engagement and assessed students' programming skills. We found that students
expressed more positive emotions while programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible
computing platforms didn't affect dramatically students' performance in computational thinking.},

increases, the nearer from the bottom left of the screen this chord is to be applied. Notably, our results give evidence of the
fact that there is a threshold (five-finger-chord) beyond which the above relation is not strong.},

navigation (repeated views) and the level of cognition/thinking required for a specific video segment. Our results indicated
that learning performance progress was slightly improved and stabilized after the third week of the video-assisted course. We
also found that attitudes regarding easiness, usability, usefulness, and acceptance of this type of course remained at the same
levels throughout the course. Finally, we triangulate analytics from diverse sources, discuss them, and provide the lessons

the third (control) group solved the same exercises (with the educational game) on paper. The results showed that the making

just playing a well-designed game, it should also consider the involvement of students with various making affordances.},

with a web video player, such as pause, play, and thirty-seconds skip or rewind. The results of our experiments indicated that
even the simple user heuristic of local maxima might effectively detect the same video-events, as indicated manually. Notably,
the proposed technique was more accurate in the detection of events that have a short duration, because those events motivated
increased user interaction in video hot-spots. The findings of this research provide evidence that we might be able to infer

examples we designed two math video games targeted to primary education students. The gameplay of the math video games embeds
addition operations in a seamless way, which has been inspired by that of classic platform games. In this way, the students are
adding numbers as part of popular gameplay mechanics and as a means to reach the video game objective, rather than as an end in
itself. The employment of well-defined principles in the design of math video games should facilitate the evaluation of
learning effectiveness by researchers. Moreover, educators can deploy alternative versions of the games in order to engage
students with diverse learning styles. For example, some students might be motived and benefited by narrative, while others by
collaboration, because it is unlikely that one type of serious video game might fit all learning styles. The proposed

which makes sense of a web video by analyzing users Replay interactions with the video player. In particular, we have modeled
the user information seeking behavior as a time series and the semantic regions as a discrete pulse of fixed width. Then, we
have calculated the correlation coefficient between the dynamically detected pulses at the local maximums of the user activity
signal and the pulse of reference. We have found that users Replay activity significantly matches the important segments in
information-rich and visually complex videos, such as lecture, how-to, and documentary. The proposed signal processing of user
activity is complementary to previous work in content-based video retrieval and provides an additional user-based dimension for
modeling the semantics of a social video on the Web.},

Accordingly, it is proposed that the aggregated users' video activity exhibits characteristic patterns. Such patterns may be
used in order to infer important video scenes leading thus to collective intelligence concerning the video content. To this
end, experimentation is based on users' interactions (e.g., pause, seek/scrub) that have been gathered in a controlled user
experiment with information-rich videos. Collective information seeking behavior is then modeled by means of the corresponding
probability distribution function. Thus, it is argued that the bell-shaped reference patterns are shown to significantly
correlate with predefined scenes of interest for each video, as annotated by the users. In this way, the observed collective
intelligence may be used to provide a video-segment detection tool that identifies the importance of video scenes. Accordingly,

3) Editing of live events is automated through the synchronization of audio across multiple viewpoints of the same event.
Moreover, we present three complementary research methods in social video retrieval: Experimental replication of user activity
data and signal analysis, data mining and prediction on natural user activity data, and hybrid techniques that combine robust
content-based approaches with crowd sourcing of user gener- ated content. Finally, we suggest further research directions in

forward one in matching the semantics of a video, and that all interesting video segments can be found within a factor of two
times the average user skipping step from the local maximums of the replay time series. The concept of simple signal processing

  abstract      = {Educators and museum curators have recognized the value of interactivity, but it remains unclear what is the
right level of interactivity in informal learning settings, such as museums. In this study, we explore the effect of in-
creasing levels of interactivity on learning performance and students' intention for future museum visits. We developed an
educational mobile application based on QR codes and quiz software, in order to augment visual arts comprehension during a
visit to an art gallery. In addition to the mobile-based version of the game, a paper-based version was also employed followed
by a controlled experiment. A total of 60 lyceum students (between 15 and 16 years old) participated in a between-groups
evaluation that compared the performance of three levels of interactivity (passive guided tour, paper-based, mobile-based), as
well as the perceptions among the groups. The results indicate that the mobile-based student group had higher performance in
the post-assessment when compared with the paper-based one. Notably, perceived interest for the game affects students'
perceptions for a future museum visit. Further research should consider the effects of higher-fidelity types of mobile
applications, such as 3D graphics, as well as augmented-reality games.},

performance in an assessment test. Most notably, the improvement was higher for students who used to have poor performance in

pause, skip). Moreover, we implemented an algorithm that selects representative thumbnails. Finally, we populated the system
with data from an experiment with nine users. We found that the VideoSkip system indexes video content by leveraging implicit
users interactions, such as pause and thirty seconds skip. Our early findings point toward improvements of the web video player

period of 11 weeks, which were exchanged by 30 students of 4 th and 5 th grade from USA and Greece. We found that the number of
views and the duration of a video message significantly depend on the gender of the viewer and creator. Most notably, girls
created more messages, but boys viewed their own messages more. Finally, there are video messages with numerous views, which
indicates that some videos have content qualities beyond the communication message itself. Overall, the practical implications
of these findings indicate that the developers of asynchronous VMC should consider functionalities for preserving some of the
video messages.},

Previous research in user-based techniques has assumed an extra effort from the users, such as video replies, comments, tags,
and annotations. We have developed and evaluated the SocialSkip system, which improves sense making of web videos by
visualizing the simplest form of user interactions with video, such as pause, and seek. In contrast to previous stand-alone
implementations, the SocialSkip system employs a web-video player and cloud-based resources (application logic, database,
content). The system was validated with two user studies, which provided several hundreds of user interactions with five types
of web video (sports, comedy, lecture, documentary, how-to). We found that seeking activity within web video is reversely
proportional to how interesting the video is. Moreover, we suggest that if the users are actively seeking for information
within a video (e.g., lecture, how-to), then the user activity graph could be associated with the semantics of the video.
Finally, SocialSkip provides an open architecture for collaborative contributions to the analysis of the user activity data, in
a fashion similar to the TRECVID workshop series.},

In the two-user condition, we found that performance and enjoyment was always higher than the single-user conditions,
regardless of input device and task. Besides the quantitative results, we observed that users employed diverse interaction
strategies in the MT condition, such as bi-manual input. The proposed tasks and the results support the use of MT in

users which derive from their Facebook experience. In the exploratory stage, 70 users generated phrases to describe the manner
they used Facebook. Interestingly, some users do not only describe the uses, but also mention how they perceive these uses.
These phrases were coded into 14 items and then clustered into 4 factors. The second stage of the study, which was addressed to
131 Facebook users, the factor analysis that was conducted, verified the validity of the four factors: Social Connection,
Social Network Surfing, Wasting Time, Using Applications. Finally, the results were analyzed in order to interpret each
factor's impact and to enable a comparison with previous research regarding the same subject. These showed how users continue
to primarily regard Facebook as a means of socializing with other users, but also the extent to which Facebook has become a
part of their daily routine, something that is indicated by the impact of the "Wasting Time" factor. Further research can be
conducted by addressing a greater number of users, selected with a less random manner and possibly with a different (cultural,
economical etc.) background.},

  abstract      = {The approach often adopted by Human Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on exchanges between a person and the
interface of a device situated within a specific context of use. This view is increasingly challenged by the complex and
dynamic world of the physical and social environment integrated with ubiquitous technologies, which requires an alternative
view that sees people creating settings which frame and structure their encounters. As a result, in recent years, HCI
researchers have recognized the need for social and physical data to be gathered and interpreted, but have often been
frustrated in their attempts to codify and make sense of the complex and dynamic nature of the real world of human experience.
Developments in the early 90s such as the emergence of the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), the
introduction of the concept of social navigation (Hook et al. 2003), work on ambient environments, the UbiComp conference
series as well as more theoretical positions on embodied or situated interaction (Dourish 2001, McCullough 2005) have all lead
the way to a new understanding of HCI. Another driver for this change in emphasis in HCI is the emergence of mobile and
ubiquitous computing that has brought significant changes in social and cultural practices in spatial settings. Interactions
through and with ubiquitous technologies no longer require physical co-presence and have broadened the range of possible
interactions as well as the range of settings in which these interactions can unfold. The basis for this lies in the fact that
physical distance no longer prevents many of the types of interactions and encounters that had previously been confined to
face-to-face contact. As a result, there has been much discussion on the role of spatial setting and interaction mediated
through technologies such as that on the role of space and agency in the quality of the interaction (Dourish and Harrisson
1996) and also the broader concept of the situated behavior and actions (Suchman 1987). A good deal has also been written on
the subject of social collaboration among individuals using communication devices and the conditions or features that are
required to enable such activities (Gaver 1992; Paulos and Goodman 2004; Hook et al. 2003; Churchill et al. 2004). Further
discussion has focused on the technologies themselves, assessing the social impact of the emerging forms of behavior, such as
the activities of ad hoc communities enabled through mobile technologies (Rheingold 2002), or the patterns of mobile phones'
use (Katz and Aakhus 2002). Finally, numerous applications and locative media projects (e.g., Harle and Hopper 2005) which
explore interactions through realization have been developed. These projects and research offer many useful insights, but there
still remain many questions about how to create the conditions for meaningful and persisting shared interactions in public
space. The challenge is not only to build systems that respond to rich and dynamic social and physical events, but also to
provide a structure for sustainable participation and sharing.},

better than those offered by the wireless operator. Simple metaphors from the real world and consistent visual depictions

Designers of mobile phone icons have to balance a trade-off between the need of the manufacturers and wireless operators to
differentiate their offerings through branding, and the need of the consumers for a familiar visual language in mobile phone

  abstract      = {The ability to deliver personalized advertising messages has long been a major objective in marketing since
it allows marketers to meet heterogeneous consumer needs and target their messages more effectively (Arens {\&} Bovee, 1994).
However, traditional one-to-many marketing approaches applied in mass media suffer from their inability to meet this objective
(Dibb, 1998; Hoffman {\&} Novak, 1997). In order to increase the efficiency of their strategy, marketers identify homogeneous
groups of consumers (market segmentation) which they target according to their marketing objectives. Thus, market segmentation
has become the most important marketing tool for targeting purposes (McBurnie {\&} Clutterbuck, 1998), also utilized in the TV
advertising domain in conjunction with domain-specific features such as time zones and/or program typologies. However, this
strategy has admittedly little to offer towards the ultimate goal of one-to-one communication, since the targeted unit is the
segment rather than the individual consumer, and therefore individual needs cannot be satisfied. In the broadcasting television
advertising domain, media coverage either exceeds the targeted market segment or leaves potential customers without exposure to
the message, thus reducing its cost effectiveness (Belch {\&} Belch, 1995). At the same time, TV viewers have to deal with a
vast amount of available advertising information. The issue of information overload, typical in information theoretic terms, is
also experienced in the case of TV advertisements as advertising clutter, which has been identified as one of the significant
factors associated with the negative attitude of viewers towards advertising and can have a negative impact on television
advertisement recall or recognition (Mord {\&} Gilson, 1985). Relevant surveys reveal that 80{\%} of the viewers feel that
there is “too much advertising in television” (Elliott {\&} Speck, 1998), while more than 75{\%} of consumers are not happy
with the broadcasted advertisements (Hawkins, Best, {\&} Coney, 1998 ). Current target marketing methods are limited in their
ability to efficiently target consumers at the individual level, particularly in mass media such as television. Thus,
personalization of advertisements provides marketers with the opportunity to increase advertising effectiveness by targeting
consumers who are most likely to respond positively to the advertising message. The present article investigates appropriate
personalization methods for the domain of digital television advertisements by examining relevant methods utilized for
personalized Web applications. In addition, it is concerned with the design of the interactive elements of a typical 30-second
advertisement in support of the personalization process. The two objectives of this article are interrelated: the selection of
a personalization technique affects the design of interactive advertisements since it indicates the type of interaction data
that should be collected in order to enable personalization. The next section of this article opens up the discussion on
personalization from a theoretical point of view and in the following section specific personalization techniques are compared.
Next, the types of interaction data required to achieve personalization are discussed and the article concludes with further
discussion and conclusions.},

results suggest that a small set of generic principles could support the systematic design of ITV applications and produce a

sharing video online. We employed cultural probes in order to gain in-depth information about the social aspect of video

consider two basic issues: What is interactive TV research? Can it help us reinvent the practices of creating, sharing and
watching TV? We survey the literature and identify three concepts that have been inherent in interactive TV research: 1)
interactive TV as content creation, 2) interactive TV as a content and experience sharing process, and 3) interactive TV as
control of audiovisual content. We propose this simple taxonomy (create-share-control) as an evolutionary step over the
traditional hierarchical produce-distribute-consume paradigm. Moreover, we highlight the importance of sociability in all
phases of the create-share-control model.},

not investigated the opportunities. This work aims to identify a framework of new business models that take advantage of the
networked DVR. For this purpose, we examined the TV literature from diverse academic disciplines, such as mass communication,
computer engineering and advertising research. We have also collaborated with network and multimedia engineers, with
broadcasters, and we examined novel interactive television (ITV) prototypes. The findings suggest that the networked DVR could
be exploited to provide personalized channels and that the dynamic advertising insertion could be introduced as an effective
advertising format. In the light of these findings, the TV industry should consider the pro-active adoption and facilitation of
the networked DVR infrastructure.},

television use as a secondary function to other activities, such as socializing, domestic chores, leisure pursuits. For this
purpose, the requirements for ambient user interactivity with TV are organized in a small set of design principles. The design
principles have been selected, analyzed and synthesized from readings in previous works on media and ethnographic studies about
television, and everyday life. It is suggested that universal access in ambient intelligence is promoted by considering design
principles such as opportunistic interaction, user participation, group interactions, and multiple levels of attention to the
user interface. Finally, the principles have been tested in the design of a user interface for interactive music television.
This preliminary case suggests that the proposed principles facilitate the design of user interfaces that blend seamlessly with
everyday life.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents the innovative approach of the IST project iMEDIA towards Consumer Clustering and
Targeted Advertising in a Digital TV Environment. iMEDIA covers the need of Advertising Companies to identify broad classes of
TV viewers who will respond similarly to marketing actions, and thus develop their target advertising techniques. The consumers
are equipped with a settop box (STB) with storage facilities and a modem. The definition of consumer profiles and clusters is
based on demographics, preferences, and analysis of the consumer interactions with the TV, which are tracked automatically. In
order to protect consumers' identities, consumer data are stored locally on the STB and the classification of a consumer in a
specific cluster takes place at the client side. Consumer data from the consumers, who permit it, is periodically transferred
to the Server where Data Mining techniques are applied. The extracted consumer behavioral rules associate the clusters with
consumer profiles and interaction/navigational data and are sent through the broadcast channel to the consumers' STBs for the
classification of each consumer and the playback of the advertisements that match consumer interests.},

  abstract      = {The birth of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1993, particularly its graphical user interface, offered marketers
opportunities that were previously unimaginable. The WWW allows advanced marketing activities and more particularly interactive
marketing, as the user is actively involved in responding to the vendor's promotion campaign. Interactive TV, also referred to
as iTV, combines the appeal and mass audience of traditional TV with the interactive features such as those currently available
on the Web. Although personalisation is a practice used widely on the Internet by many sites, applying personalisation
techniques over interactive television presents a number of difficulties. In this paper we focus on the design and testing
process of the User Interface (UI) for the Interactive {\&} Personalized Advertisement TV viewer. We argue that there are a lot
of challenges involved in the designing of interactive TV applications. These are related with the differences of the medium
from the traditional PC based Information Systems in terms of input and output devices, viewing environment, number of users
and low level of expertise in PC usage.},
