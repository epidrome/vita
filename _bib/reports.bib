that reside in remote (rural, islands) areas. For this purpose, we are employing both established and novel interaction and
communication technologies. Moreover, we are working closely with schools and teachers, in order to leverage their ability to
adopt and adapt technologies in ways that are suitable for their skills and needs. In particular, we have shaped our
understanding about remote schools by means of an extended cultural probes study, which was administered during the first part
of the research. Then, we have established a series of local workshops that involved teachers in the adoption and adaptation of
novel technologies in ways that are suitable for them. Moreover, we have developed and evaluated novel user interfaces for
interactive whiteboards that facilitate collaborative learning, as well as a video assisted distance learning system.},

  title         = {{Virtual television channels: Conceptual model, user interface design and affective usability evaluation}},

  abstract      = {This doctoral dissertation aims to investigate user interface (UI) design, implementation and evaluation for
interactive television (ITV) applications. Computer mediated entertainment (e.g. video-games, digital music, DVD movies, ITV)
has emerged as a major economic factor in the media industry, taking-up a large portion of consumer spending and leisure time.
Advances in set-top box technology made possible the digital video recorder (DVR) and Internet connectivity, thus making the
television interactive. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the established human-computer interaction (HCI)
theory against the requirements of ITV applications. Previous HCI research about ITV focused only on the design of the
electronic program guide (EPG) and did not consider the enhancement of the TV content. Furthermore, previous research
approached ITV from a single perspective (e.g. computer engineering, advertising, communication) and it did not consider the
conflicts of interest between the broadcasters and the consumers, between the developers and the producers, and more crucially,
it did not consider the ITV user as a TV viewer. For this purpose, the established TV watching behavior is identified in other
scientific disciplines, such as advertising and communication, and it is combined with the Information Technology (IT)
usability mentality. The design methodology involves two phases. The objective of the first design phase is to formulate a
small set of principal elements that are generic to the design of ITV UIs, such as Virtual Channel conceptual model, UI
principles, UI development toolkit, prototyping platform, and affective usability evaluation framework. The objective of the
second design phase is to employ the elements identified in the previous stage into the development of an ITV application. The
ITV application was evaluated by consumers and addressed three contemporary UI issues: video skipping, animated character, and
dynamic advertisement insertion. Overall, the methodology employed a holistic design approach for ITV applications, in which
the UI model and the business model were systematically mapped to and validated through an ITV music application. In brief, it
was found that the track-skipping UI seamlessly enhanced consumer entertainment. Moreover, it was found that an animated
character is preferred, when compared with the traditional transparent box for the presentation of related information.
Consumers evaluated the dynamic advertisement insertion positively, thus, opening-up many opportunities for novel advertising
formats. The employment of the proposed HCI elements made the design and the development of the ITV application a
straightforward process and produced an entertainment experience that was liked by the consumers. The results entail
significant implications for the TV industry. ITV is currently perceived as a set of decorative elements, which do not provide
any actual improvement of the existing TV content. On the other hand, video-skipping is a familiar functionality that should be
exploited, instead of neglected due to the fear of cannibalizing the fixed advertising of the broadcast schedules. The dynamic
advertisement insertion in the TV content stream offers a novel advertising format. Finally, there are opportunities for a new
mediating role in the media industry that combines the available broadcast transmission with additional elements (Internet
resources, computer generated graphics) for the provision of personalized virtual television channels.},
