  abstract      = {The ability to deliver personalized advertising messages has long been a major objective in marketing since
it allows marketers to meet heterogeneous consumer needs and target their messages more effectively (Arens {\&} Bovee, 1994).
However, traditional one-to-many marketing approaches applied in mass media suffer from their inability to meet this objective
(Dibb, 1998; Hoffman {\&} Novak, 1997). In order to increase the efficiency of their strategy, marketers identify homogeneous
groups of consumers (market segmentation) which they target according to their marketing objectives. Thus, market segmentation
has become the most important marketing tool for targeting purposes (McBurnie {\&} Clutterbuck, 1998), also utilized in the TV
advertising domain in conjunction with domain-specific features such as time zones and/or program typologies. However, this
strategy has admittedly little to offer towards the ultimate goal of one-to-one communication, since the targeted unit is the
segment rather than the individual consumer, and therefore individual needs cannot be satisfied. In the broadcasting television
advertising domain, media coverage either exceeds the targeted market segment or leaves potential customers without exposure to
the message, thus reducing its cost effectiveness (Belch {\&} Belch, 1995). At the same time, TV viewers have to deal with a
vast amount of available advertising information. The issue of information overload, typical in information theoretic terms, is
also experienced in the case of TV advertisements as advertising clutter, which has been identified as one of the significant
factors associated with the negative attitude of viewers towards advertising and can have a negative impact on television
advertisement recall or recognition (Mord {\&} Gilson, 1985). Relevant surveys reveal that 80{\%} of the viewers feel that
there is “too much advertising in television” (Elliott {\&} Speck, 1998), while more than 75{\%} of consumers are not happy
with the broadcasted advertisements (Hawkins, Best, {\&} Coney, 1998 ). Current target marketing methods are limited in their
ability to efficiently target consumers at the individual level, particularly in mass media such as television. Thus,
personalization of advertisements provides marketers with the opportunity to increase advertising effectiveness by targeting
consumers who are most likely to respond positively to the advertising message. The present article investigates appropriate
personalization methods for the domain of digital television advertisements by examining relevant methods utilized for
personalized Web applications. In addition, it is concerned with the design of the interactive elements of a typical 30-second
advertisement in support of the personalization process. The two objectives of this article are interrelated: the selection of
a personalization technique affects the design of interactive advertisements since it indicates the type of interaction data
that should be collected in order to enable personalization. The next section of this article opens up the discussion on
personalization from a theoretical point of view and in the following section specific personalization techniques are compared.
Next, the types of interaction data required to achieve personalization are discussed and the article concludes with further
discussion and conclusions.},

participants to explore a map narrative, and engage in group interactions through a shared screen. For this purpose, several
layers of cartographic information were employed in a computer application, which was programmed with motion-tracking libraries
in the open source tool processing. The interactive video installation has been chosen as a medium to achieve the following
aims: (1) The visualization of urban-conflict as an interactive map narrative, and (2) the encouragement of social encounters
through a shared screen. The development process begins with the design of interaction between the system and the participants,
as well as between the participants themselves. Then we map the interaction design concepts into multimedia and architectural
design. Finally, we provide a discussion on the creative process and the collaboration between different disciplines, such as
architecture, urban planning, cartography, computer engineering, and media studies.},

  abstract      = {The approach often adopted by Human Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on exchanges between a person and the
interface of a device situated within a specific context of use. This view is increasingly challenged by the complex and
dynamic world of the physical and social environment integrated with ubiquitous technologies, which requires an alternative
view that sees people creating settings which frame and structure their encounters. As a result, in recent years, HCI
researchers have recognized the need for social and physical data to be gathered and interpreted, but have often been
frustrated in their attempts to codify and make sense of the complex and dynamic nature of the real world of human experience.
Developments in the early 90s such as the emergence of the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), the
introduction of the concept of social navigation (Hook et al. 2003), work on ambient environments, the UbiComp conference
series as well as more theoretical positions on embodied or situated interaction (Dourish 2001, McCullough 2005) have all lead
the way to a new understanding of HCI. Another driver for this change in emphasis in HCI is the emergence of mobile and
ubiquitous computing that has brought significant changes in social and cultural practices in spatial settings. Interactions
through and with ubiquitous technologies no longer require physical co-presence and have broadened the range of possible
interactions as well as the range of settings in which these interactions can unfold. The basis for this lies in the fact that
physical distance no longer prevents many of the types of interactions and encounters that had previously been confined to
face-to-face contact. As a result, there has been much discussion on the role of spatial setting and interaction mediated
through technologies such as that on the role of space and agency in the quality of the interaction (Dourish and Harrisson
1996) and also the broader concept of the situated behavior and actions (Suchman 1987). A good deal has also been written on
the subject of social collaboration among individuals using communication devices and the conditions or features that are
required to enable such activities (Gaver 1992; Paulos and Goodman 2004; Hook et al. 2003; Churchill et al. 2004). Further
discussion has focused on the technologies themselves, assessing the social impact of the emerging forms of behavior, such as
the activities of ad hoc communities enabled through mobile technologies (Rheingold 2002), or the patterns of mobile phones'
use (Katz and Aakhus 2002). Finally, numerous applications and locative media projects (e.g., Harle and Hopper 2005) which
explore interactions through realization have been developed. These projects and research offer many useful insights, but there
still remain many questions about how to create the conditions for meaningful and persisting shared interactions in public
space. The challenge is not only to build systems that respond to rich and dynamic social and physical events, but also to
provide a structure for sustainable participation and sharing.},

of research has been mostly concerned with technology and standards, which are necessary to ensure interoperability and market
acceptance. Although, there has been a significant body of computer-supported co-operative work (CSCW) and mobile
human–computer interaction (HCI) research findings, there is limited investigation in the context of leisure activities, such
as TV. In this article, we propose three concepts that drive the main paths for research and practice in mobile and social TV:
(1) Mobile TV as a content format, (2) Mobile TV as user behavior, and (3) Mobile TV as interaction terminal. Finally, we
provide particular directions to be considered in further research in social and mobile TV.},

regarded the increasingly dynamic interactions between users and content. We present a comprehensive survey on user-based
techniques and instrumentation for social video retrieval researchers. Community-based approaches suggest there is much to
learn about an unstructured video just by analyzing the dynamics of how it is being used. In particular, we explore three
pillars of online user activity with video content: 1) Seeking patterns within a video is linked to interesting video segments,
2) Sharing patterns between users indicate that there is a correlation between social activity and popularity of a video, and
3) Editing of live events is automated through the synchronization of audio across multiple viewpoints of the same event.
Moreover, we present three complementary research methods in social video retrieval: Experimental replication of user activity
data and signal analysis, data mining and prediction on natural user activity data, and hybrid techniques that combine robust
content-based approaches with crowd sourcing of user gener- ated content. Finally, we suggest further research directions in
the combination of richer user- and content-modeling, because it provides an attractive solution to the personalization,
navigation, and social consumption of videos.},
